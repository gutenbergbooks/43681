<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The success of this book has been much beyond my
expectations. That a considerable edition has been exhausted within a
few months after publication proves that it meets a want.</p>
<p>I have now practically re-written the book, and have taken the
opportunity of introducing a considerable amount of fresh information
collected in the course of the Ethnographical Survey of the
North-Western Provinces, the results of which will be separately
published.</p>
<p>For the illustrations, which now appear for the first time, I am
indebted to the photographic skill of Mr. J. O&rsquo;Neal, of the
Thomason Engineering College, Rurki. I could have wished that they
could have been drawn from a wider area. But Hardwar and its shrines
are very fairly representative of popular Hinduism in Northern
India.</p>

<h3 class="main">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many books have been written on Br&acirc;hmanism, or
the official religion of the Hindu; but, as far as I am aware, this is
the first attempt to bring together some of the information available
on the popular beliefs of the races of Upper India.</p>
<p>My object in writing this book has been threefold. In the first
place I desired to collect, for the use of all officers whose work lies
among the rural classes, some information on the beliefs of the people
which will enable them, in some degree, to understand the mysterious
inner life of the races among whom their lot is cast; secondly, it may
be hoped that this introductory sketch will stimulate inquiry,
particularly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e240" href="#xd21e240"
name="xd21e240">vi</a>]</span>among the educated races of the country,
who have, as yet, done little to enable Europeans to gain a fuller and
more sympathetic knowledge of their rural brethren; and lastly, while I
have endeavoured more to collect facts than to theorize upon them, I
hope that European scholars may find in these pages some fresh examples
of familiar principles. My difficulty has arisen not so much from
deficiency of material, as in the selection and arrangement of the mass
of information, which lies scattered through a considerable literature,
much of which is fugitive.</p>
<p>I believe that the more we explore these popular superstitions and
usages, the nearer are we likely to attain to the discovery of the
basis on which Hinduism has been founded. The official creed has always
been characterized by extreme catholicism and receptivity, and many of
its principles and legends have undoubtedly been derived from that
stratum of the people which it is convenient to call non-Aryan or
Dr&acirc;vidian. The necessity, then, of investigating these beliefs
before they become absorbed in Br&acirc;hminism, one of the most active
missionary religions of the world, is obvious.</p>
<p>I may say that the materials of this book were practically complete
before I was able to use Mr. J. S. Campbell&rsquo;s valuable collection
of &ldquo;Notes on the Spirit Basis of Belief and Custom;&rdquo; but,
in revising the manuscript, I have availed myself to some extent of
this useful collection, and when I have done so, I have been careful to
acknowledge my obligations to it. Even at the risk of overloading the
notes with references, I have quoted the authorities which I have used,
and I have added a Bibliography which may be of use to students to whom
the subject is unfamiliar.</p>
<p>The only excuse I can plead for the obvious imperfections of this
hasty survey of a very wide subject is that it has been written in the
intervals of the scanty leisure of a District Officer&rsquo;s life in

<p class="first xd21e393"><i>Iliad</i>, xviii. 483&ndash;88.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among all the great religions of the world there is
none more catholic, more assimilative than the mass of beliefs which go
to make up what is popularly known as Hinduism. To what was probably
its original form&mdash;a nature worship in a large degree introduced
by the Aryan missionaries&mdash;has been added an enormous amount of
demonolatry, fetishism and kindred forms of primitive religion, much of
which has been adopted from races which it is convenient to describe as
aboriginal or autochthonous.</p>
<p>The same was the case in Western lands. As the Romans extended their
Empire they brought with them and included in the national pantheon the
deities of the conquered peoples. Greece and Syria, Egypt, Gallia and
Germania were thus successively laid under contribution. This power of
assimilation in the domain of religion had its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>advantages
as well as its dangers. While on the one hand it tended to promote the
unity of the empire, it degraded, on the other hand, the national
character by the introduction of the impure cults which flourished
along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e403src" href="#xd21e403" name="xd21e403src">1</a></p>
<p>But, besides these forms of religion which were directly imported
from foreign lands, there remained a stratum of local beliefs which
even after twenty centuries of Christianity still flourish, discredited
though they may be by priests and placed under the ban of the official
creed. Thus in Greece, while the high gods of the divine race of
Achilles and Agamemnon are forgotten, the Nereids, the Cyclopes and the
Lamia still live in the faith of the peasants of Thessaly.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e408src" href="#xd21e408" name="xd21e408src">2</a> So
in modern Tuscany there is actually as much heathenism as catholicism,
and they still believe in <span lang="it">La Vecchia
Religione</span>&mdash;&ldquo;the old religion;&rdquo;&mdash;and while
on great occasions they have recourse to the priests, they use magic
and witchcraft for all ordinary purposes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e414src" href="#xd21e414" name="xd21e414src">3</a></p>
<p>It is part of the object of the following pages to show that in
India the history of religious belief has been developed on similar
lines. Everywhere we find that the great primal gods of Hinduism have
suffered grievous degradation. Throughout the length and breadth of the
Indian peninsula Brahma, the Creator, has hardly more than a couple of
shrines specially dedicated to him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e419src"
href="#xd21e419" name="xd21e419src">4</a> Indra has, as we shall see,
become a vague weather deity, who rules the choirs of fairies in his
heaven Indra-loka: Varuna, as Barun, has also become a degraded weather
godling, and sailors worship their boat as his fetish when they
commence a voyage. The worship of Agni survives in the fire sacrifice
which has been specialized by the Agnihotri Br&acirc;hmans. Of
P&ucirc;shan and Ushas, V&acirc;yu and the Maruts, hardly even the
names survive, except among the small philosophical class of reformers
who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>aim at restoring Vedism, a faith which is as dead as
Jupiter or Aphrodite.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Deva.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The general term for these great gods of Hinduism is
Deva, or &ldquo;the shining ones.&rdquo; Of these even the survivors
have in the course of the development of the religious belief of the
people suffered serious change. Modern Vaishnavism has little left of
the original conception of the solar deity who in the Rig Veda strides
in three steps through the seven regions of the universe, and envelops
all things in the dust of his beams. To his cult has, in modern times,
been added the erotic cycle of myths which centre round Krishna and
R&acirc;dh&acirc; and Rukmin&icirc;. The successive Avat&acirc;ras or
incarnations mark the progressive development of the cultus which has
absorbed in succession the totemistic or fetish worship of the
tortoise, the boar, the fish and the man-lion. In the same way
Rudra-Siva has annexed various faiths, many of which are probably of
local origin, such as the worship of the bull and the linga.
Durg&acirc;-Dev&icirc;, again, most likely is indebted to the same
sources for the blood sacrifices which she loves in her forms of
K&acirc;l&icirc;, Bhaw&acirc;n&icirc;, Chandik&acirc; or
Bhairav&icirc;. A still later development is that of the foul mysteries
of the Tantra and the S&acirc;ktis.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Deot&acirc;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But in the present survey of the popular, as
contrasted with the official faith, we have little concern with these
supremely powerful deities. They are the gods of the richer or higher
classes, and to the ordinary peasant of Northern India are now little
more than a name. He will, it is true, occasionally bow at their
shrines; he will pour some water or lay some flowers on the images or
fetish stones which are the special resting-places of these divinities
or represent the productive powers of nature. But from time immemorial,
when Br&acirc;hmanism had as yet not succeeded in occupying the land,
his allegiance was bestowed on a class of deities <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>of a much
lower and more primitive kind. Their inferiority to the greater gods is
marked in their title: they are Devat&acirc; or Deot&acirc;,
&ldquo;godlings,&rdquo; not &ldquo;gods.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e439src" href="#xd21e439" name="xd21e439src">5</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Godlings Pure and Impure.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These godlings fall into two well marked
classes&mdash;the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; and the &ldquo;impure.&rdquo; The
former are, as a rule, served by priests of the Br&acirc;hman castes or
one of the ascetic orders: their offerings are such things as are pure
food to the Hindu&mdash;cakes of wheaten flour, particularly those
which have been still further purified by intermixture with clarified
butter (<i>gh&icirc;</i>), the most valued product of the sacred cow,
washed rice (<i>akshata</i>) and sweetmeats. They are very generally
worshipped on a Sunday, and the officiating high-caste priest accepts
the offerings. The offerings to the &ldquo;impure&rdquo; godlings
contain articles such as pork and spirits, which are abomination to the
orthodox Hindu. In the Central Indian hills their priest is the Baiga,
who rules the ghosts and demons of the village and is always drawn from
one of the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes. In the plain country the priest is a
non-Aryan Cham&acirc;r, Dus&acirc;dh, or even a sweeper or a Muhammadan
Daf&acirc;li or drummer. No respectable Hindu will, it is needless to
say, partake of a share of the food consecrated (<i>pras&acirc;d</i>)
to a hedge deity of this class. Much of the worship consists in
offering of blood. But the jungle man or the village menial of the
plains can seldom, except in an hour of grievous need, afford an
expensive animal victim, and it is only when the village shrine has
come under the patronage of the official priests of the orthodox faith,
that the altar of the goddess reeks with gore, like those of the
Dev&icirc;s of Bindh&acirc;chal or Dev&icirc; P&acirc;tan.</p>
<p>But as regards the acceptance of a share of the offering the line is
often not very rigidly drawn. As Mr. Ibbetson writing of the
Panj&acirc;b says:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e458src" href="#xd21e458"
name="xd21e458src">6</a> &ldquo;Of course, the line cannot always be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>drawn with precision, and Br&acirc;hmans will often
consent to be fed in the name of a deity, while they will not take
offerings made at his shrine, or will allow their girls, but not their
boys, to accept the offering, as, if the girls die in consequence, it
does not much matter.&rdquo; In fact, as we shall see later on, the
Baiga or devil priest of the aboriginal tribes, is gradually merging
into the Ojha or meaner class of demon exorciser, who calls himself a
Br&acirc;hman and performs the same functions for tribes of a somewhat
higher social rank.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">S&ucirc;raj N&acirc;r&acirc;yan, the Sun Godling.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first and greatest of the &ldquo;pure&rdquo;
godlings is S&ucirc;rya or S&ucirc;raj N&acirc;r&acirc;yan, the Sun
godling. He is thus regarded as N&acirc;r&acirc;yana or Vishnu
occupying the sun. A curiously primitive legend represents his
father-in-law, Viswakarma, as placing the deity on his lathe and
trimming away one-eighth of his effulgence, leaving only his feet. Out
of the blazing fragments he welded the weapons of the gods. S&ucirc;rya
was one of the great deities of the Vedic pantheon: he is called
Prajapati or &ldquo;lord of creatures:&rdquo; he was the son of Dyaus,
or the bright sky. Ushas, the dawn, was his wife, and he moves through
the sky drawn by seven ruddy mares. His worship was perhaps originally
connected with that of fire, but it is easy to understand how, under a
tropical sky, the Indian peasant came to look on him as the lord of
life and death, the bringer of plenty or of famine. If one
interpretation of the rite be correct, the Hol&icirc; festival is
intended as a means of propitiating sunshine. He is now, however, like
Helios in the Homeric mythology, looked on as only a godling, not a
god, and even as a hero who had once lived and reigned on earth.</p>
<p>As far as the village worship of S&ucirc;raj N&acirc;r&acirc;yan
goes, the assertion, which has sometimes been made, that no shrine has
been erected in his honour is correct enough; and there is no doubt
that images of S&ucirc;rya and Aditya are comparatively rare in recent
epochs. But there are many noted temples dedicated to him, such as
those at Taxila, Gw&acirc;lior, Gaya, Mult&acirc;n, Jaypur, and in the
North-Western Provinces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6"
name="pb6">6</a>]</span>at Indor, Hawalb&acirc;gh, S&ucirc;rya
Bh&icirc;ta and Lakhmipur.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e473src" href=
"#xd21e473" name="xd21e473src">7</a> His shrine at Kan&acirc;rak in
Orissa near that of Jagann&acirc;th, is described as one of the most
exquisite memorials of Sun-worship in existence.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e476src" href="#xd21e476" name="xd21e476src">8</a> Mr. Bendall
recently found in Nep&acirc;l an image dedicated to him as late as the
eleventh century.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e479src" href="#xd21e479"
name="xd21e479src">9</a> There is a small shrine in his honour close to
the Annap&ucirc;rna temple in Benares, where the god is represented
seated in a chariot drawn by seven horses, and is worshipped with the
fire sacrifice (<i>homa</i>) in a building detached from the
temple.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e486src" href="#xd21e486" name=
"xd21e486src">10</a></p>
<p>In the time of Sankara Ach&acirc;rya (<span class="sc">A.D.</span>
1000) there were six distinct sects of Sun-worshippers&mdash;one
worshipping the rising sun as identified with Brahma; the second the
meridian sun as Siva; the third the setting sun as Vishnu; the fourth
worshippers of the sun in all the above phases as identified with the
Trimurti; the fifth worshippers of the sun regarded as a material being
in the form of a man with a golden beard and golden hair. Zealous
members of this sect refused to eat anything in the morning till they
had seen the sun rise. The last class worshipped an image of the sun
formed in the mind. These spent all their time meditating on the sun,
and were in the habit of branding circular representations of his disc
on their foreheads, arms and breasts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e494src" href="#xd21e494" name="xd21e494src">11</a></p>
<p>The Saura sect worship S&ucirc;ryapati as their special god. They
wear a crystal necklace in his honour, abstain from eating salt on
Sundays and on the days when the sun enters a sign of the zodiac. They
make a frontal mark with red sandars, and nowadays have their
headquarters in Oudh.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e499src" href=
"#xd21e499" name="xd21e499src">12</a></p>
<p>Another sect of Vaishnavas, the N&icirc;mb&acirc;rak, worship the
sun in a modified form. Their name means &ldquo;the sun in a N&icirc;m
tree&rdquo; (<i>Azidirachta Indica</i>). The story of the sect runs
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>that their founder, an ascetic named
Bh&acirc;skar&acirc;ch&acirc;rya, had invited a Bair&acirc;gi to dine
with him, and had arranged everything for his reception, but
unfortunately delayed to call his guest till after sunset. The holy man
was forbidden by the rules of his order to eat except in the day-time,
and was afraid that he would be compelled to practise an unwilling
abstinence; but at the solicitation of his host, the Sun god,
S&ucirc;raj N&acirc;r&acirc;yan, descended on the N&icirc;m tree under
which the feast was spread and continued beaming on them until dinner
was over.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e509src" href="#xd21e509" name=
"xd21e509src">13</a> In this we observe an approximation to the Jaina
rule by which it is forbidden to eat after sunset, lest insects may
enter the mouth and be destroyed. This over-strained respect for animal
life is one of the main features of the creed. As a curious parallel it
may be noted that when an Australian black-fellow wishes to stay the
sun from going down till he gets home, he places a sod in the fork of a
tree exactly facing the setting sun; and an Indian of Yucatan,
journeying westward, places a stone in a tree, or pulls out some of his
eye-lashes and blows them towards the sun.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e515src" href="#xd21e515" name="xd21e515src">14</a></p>
<p>The great Emperor Akbar endeavoured to introduce a special form of
Sun-worship. He ordered that it was to be adored four times a day: in
the morning, noon, evening, and midnight. &ldquo;His majesty had also
one thousand and one Sanskrit names of the sun collected, and read them
daily, devoutly turning to the sun. He then used to get hold of both
ears, and turning himself quickly round, used to strike the lower ends
of his ears with his fists.&rdquo; He ordered his band to play at
midnight, and used to be weighed against gold at his solar
anniversary.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e520src" href="#xd21e520" name=

<h3 class="main">Village Worship of S&ucirc;raj
N&acirc;r&acirc;yan.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The village worship of S&ucirc;raj N&acirc;r&acirc;yan
is quite distinct from this. Many peasants in Upper India do not eat
salt on Sundays, and do not set their milk for butter, but make
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>rice-milk of it, and give a portion to
Br&acirc;hmans. Br&acirc;hmans are sometimes fed in his honour at
harvests, and the pious householder bows to him as he leaves his house
in the morning. His more learned brethren repeat the
G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, that most ancient of Aryan prayers:
&ldquo;<i lang="sa-latn">Tat savitur varenyam bhargo devasya
dh&icirc;mahi, Dhiyo yo nah prachoday&acirc;t</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;May we
receive the glorious brightness of this, the generator, the God who
shall prosper our works!&rdquo;). In the chilly mornings of the cold
weather you will hear the sleepy coolies as they wake, yawning and
muttering <i>S&ucirc;raj N&acirc;r&acirc;yan</i>, as the yellow gleam
of dawn spreads over the Eastern sky. In fact, even in Vedic times
there seems to have been a local worship of S&ucirc;rya connected with
some primitive folk-lore. Haradatta mentions as one of the customs not
sanctioned in the Veda, that when the sun is in Aries the young girls
would paint the sun with his retinue on the soil in coloured dust, and
worship this in the morning and evening;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e536src" href="#xd21e536" name="xd21e536src">16</a> and in Central
India the sun was in the Middle Ages worshipped under the local form of
Bh&acirc;illa, or &ldquo;Lord of Life,&rdquo; a term which appears to
have been the origin of the name Bhilsa, known to more recent ages as a
famous seat of Buddhism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e539src" href=
"#xd21e539" name="xd21e539src">17</a></p>
<p>At Udaypur in R&acirc;jput&acirc;na the sun has universal
precedence. His portal (<i>S&ucirc;ryapul</i>) is the chief entrance to
the city; his name gives dignity to the chief apartment or hall
(<i>S&ucirc;ryamahal</i>) of the palace, and from the balcony of the
sun (<i>S&ucirc;rya-gokhru</i>), the descendant of R&acirc;ma shows
himself in the dark monsoon as the sun&rsquo;s representative. A large
painted sun of gypsum in high relief with gilded rays adorns the hall
of audience, and in front of it is the throne. The sacred standard
bears his image, as does the disc (<i>chang&icirc;</i>) of black felt
or ostrich feathers with a plate of gold in its centre to represent the
sun, borne aloft on a pole. The royal parasol is called Kiraniya, in
allusion to its shape, like a ray (<i>kiran</i>) of the orb.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e563src" href="#xd21e563" name="xd21e563src">18</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another famous centre of Sun-worship was Mult&acirc;n, where, as we
have seen, a temple dedicated to him has been discovered, and where the
tribes of the B&acirc;las and K&acirc;this were devoted to him. The
worship continued till the idol was destroyed by orders of
Aurangzeb.</p>

<h3 class="main">Sun-worship among the non-Aryan Races.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Aheriyas, a tribe of jungle-livers and thieves in
the Central Du&acirc;b of the Ganges and Jumna, have adopted as their
mythical ancestor Priyavrata, who being dissatisfied that only half the
earth was at one time illuminated by the rays of the sun, followed him
seven times round the earth in his flaming car, resolved to turn night
into day. But he was stopped by Brahma, and the wheels of his chariot
formed the seven oceans which divide the seven continents of the
world.</p>
<p>In the lower ranges of the Him&acirc;laya Sun-worship is conducted
in the months of December and January and when eclipses occur. The
principal observances are the eating of a meal without salt at each
passage of the sun into a new sign of zodiac, and eating meals on other
days only when the sun has risen.</p>
<p>Among the Dr&acirc;vidian races, along the Central Indian hills,
Sun-worship is widely prevalent. When in great affliction the
Kharw&acirc;rs appeal to the sun. Any open space in which he shines may
be his altar. The Kis&acirc;ns offer a white cock to him when a
sacrifice is needed. He is worshipped by the Bhuiyas and Or&acirc;ons
as Bor&acirc;m or Dharm Devat&acirc;, &ldquo;the godling of
pity,&rdquo; and is propitiated at the sowing season by the sacrifice
of a white cock. The Korwas worship him as Bhagw&acirc;n, or &ldquo;the
only God,&rdquo; in an open space with an ant-hill as an altar. The
Khariyas adore him under the name of Bero. &ldquo;Every head of a
family should during his lifetime make not less than five sacrifices to
this deity&mdash;the first of fowls, the second of a pig, the third of
a white goat, the fourth of a ram, and the fifth of a buffalo. He is
then considered sufficiently propitiated for that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>generation, and regarded as an ungrateful god if
he does not behave handsomely to his votary.&rdquo; He is addressed as
Parameswar, or &ldquo;great god,&rdquo; and his sacrifices are always
made in front of an ant-hill which is regarded as his altar. The Kols
worship Sing Bonga, the creator and preserver, as the sun. Prayer and
sacrifice are made to him, as to a beneficent deity, who has no
pleasure in the destruction of any of his subjects, though, as a
father, he chastises his erring children, who owe him gratitude for all
the blessings they enjoy. He is said to have married Chando Omal, the
moon. She deceived him on one occasion, and he cut her in two; but
repenting of his anger, he restores her to her original shape once a
month, when she shines in her full beauty. The Or&acirc;ons address the
sun as Dharmi, or &ldquo;the holy one,&rdquo; and do not regard him as
the author of sickness or calamity; but he may be invoked to avert it,
and this appeal is often made when the sacrifices to minor deities have
been unproductive. He is the tribal god of the Korkus of
Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d; they do not, however, offer libations to him,
as Hindus do; but once in three years the head of each family, on some
Sunday in April or May, offers outside the village a white she-goat and
a white fowl, turning his face to the East during the sacrifice.
Similarly the K&ucirc;rs of the Central Provinces carve rude
representations of the sun and moon on wooden pillars, which they
worship, near their villages.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e580src" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is needless to say that the custom of walking round
any sacred object in the course of the sun prevails widely. Thus in
Ireland, when in a graveyard, it is customary to walk as much as
possible &ldquo;with the sun,&rdquo; with the right hand towards the
centre of the circle.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e588src" href=
"#xd21e588" name="xd21e588src">20</a> Even to this day in the Hebrides
animals are led round a sick person, following the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>sun; and
in the Highlands it is the custom to make the &ldquo;deazil&rdquo; or
walk three times in the sun&rsquo;s course round those whom they wish
well. When a Highlander goes to bathe or to drink water out of a
consecrated spring, he must always approach by going round the place
from east to west on the south side, in imitation of the daily motion
of the sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e593src" href="#xd21e593" name=
"xd21e593src">21</a> We follow the same rule when we pass the decanters
round our dinner tables. In the same way in India the bride and
bridegroom are made to revolve round the sacred fire or the central
pole of the marriage-shed in the course of the sun; the pilgrim makes
his solemn perambulation (<i>parikrama</i>) round a temple or shrine in
the same way; in this direction the cattle move as they tread out the
grain.</p>
<p>One special part of the purificatory rite following childbirth is to
bring the mother out and expose her to the rays of the sun. All through
the range of popular belief and folk-lore appears the idea that girls
may be impregnated by the sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e601src" href=
"#xd21e601" name="xd21e601src">22</a> Hence they are not allowed to
expose themselves to his rays at the menstrual period. For the same
reason the bride is brought out to salute the rising sun on the morning
after she begins to live with her husband. A survival of the same
belief may be traced in the English belief that happy is the bride on
whom the sun shines. The same belief in the power of the sun is shown
in the principle so common in folk-lore that to show a certain thing to
it (in a Kashm&icirc;r tale it is a tuft of the hair of the kindly
tigress) will be sufficient to summon an absent friend.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e604src" href="#xd21e604" name=
"xd21e604src">23</a></p>
<p>The mystical emblem of the Sw&acirc;stika, which appears to
represent the sun in his journey through the heavens, is of constant
occurrence. The trader paints it on the fly-leaf of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>his
ledger; the man who has young children or animals liable to the Evil
Eye makes a representation of it on the wall beside his door-post; it
holds the first place among the lucky marks of the Jainas; it is drawn
on the shaven heads of children on the marriage-day in Gujar&acirc;t; a
red circle with a Sw&acirc;stika in the centre is depicted on the place
where the gods are kept.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e611src" href=
"#xd21e611" name="xd21e611src">24</a> In those parts of the country
where Bh&ucirc;miya is worshipped as a village guardian deity his
votary constructs a rude model of it on the shrine by fixing up two
crossed straws with a daub of plaster. It often occurs in folk-lore. In
the drama of the &ldquo;Toy Cart&rdquo; the thief hesitates whether he
shall make the hole in the wall of Charudatta&rsquo;s house in the
likeness of a Sw&acirc;stika or of a water jar. A hymn of the
Rigveda<a class="noteref" id="xd21e614src" href="#xd21e614" name=
"xd21e614src">25</a> speaks of the all-seeing eye of the sun whose
beams reveal his presence, gleaming like brilliant flames to nation
after nation. This same conception of the sun as an eye is common in
the folk-lore of the West.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e617src" href=

<h3 class="main">Moon-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The fate of Chandra or Soma, the Moon godling, is very
similar. The name Soma, originally applied to the plant the juice of
which was used as a religious intoxicant, came to be used in connection
with the moon in the post-Vedic mythology. There are many legends to
account for the waning of the moon and the spots on his surface, for
the moon, like the sun, is always treated as a male godling. One of the
legends current to explain the phases of the moon has been already
referred to. According to another story the moon married the
twenty-seven asterisms, the daughters of the Rishi Daksha, who is the
hero of the curious tale of the sacrifice now located at Kankhal, a
suburb of Hardw&acirc;r. Um&acirc; or P&acirc;rvat&icirc;, the spouse
of Siva, was also a daughter of Daksha, and when he, offended with his
son-in-law Siva, did not invite him to the great sacrifice,
<span class="corr" id="xd21e625" title="Source: Uma">Um&acirc;</span>
became Sat&icirc;, and in his rage Siva created V&icirc;rabhadra, who
killed the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>sage. Soma after marrying the asterisms devoted
himself to one of them, Rohin&icirc;, which aroused the jealousy of the
others. They complained to their father Daksha, who cursed the moon
with childlessness and consumption. His wives, in pity, interceded for
him, but the curse of the angry sage could not be wholly removed: all
that was possible was to modify it so that it should be periodical, not
permanent. In an earlier legend, of which there is a trace in the Rig
Veda,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e630src" href="#xd21e630" name=
"xd21e630src">27</a> the gods, by drinking up the nectar, caused the
waning of the moon. Another curious explanation is current in Bombay.
One evening Ganesa fell off his steed, the rat, and the moon could not
help laughing at his misfortune. To punish him the angry god vowed that
no one should ever see the moon again. The moon prayed for forgiveness,
and Ganesa agreed that the moon should be disgraced only on his
birthday, the Ganesa Chaturth&icirc;. On this night the wild hogs hide
themselves that they may not see the moon, and the Kunbis hunt them
down and kill them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e633src" href="#xd21e633"
name="xd21e633src">28</a></p>
<p>There are also many explanations to account for the spots in the
moon. In Western lands the moon is inhabited by a man with a bundle of
sticks on his back; but it is not clear of what offence this was the
punishment. Dante says he is Cain; Chaucer says he was a thief, and
gives him a thorn-bush to carry; Shakespeare gives him thorns to carry,
but provides him with a dog as a companion. In Ireland children are
taught that he picked faggots on a Sunday and is punished as a
Sabbath-breaker. In India the creature in the moon is usually a hare,
and hence the moon is called Sasadhara, &ldquo;he that is marked like a
hare.&rdquo; According to one legend the moon became enamoured of
Ahaly&acirc;, the wife of the Rishi Gautama, and visited her in the
absence of her husband. He returned, and finding the guilty pair
together, cursed his wife, who was turned into a stone; then he threw
his shoe at the moon, which left a black mark, and this remains to this
day. The scene of this event has been <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>localized at Gondar in
the Karn&acirc;l District. By another variant of the legend it was
Vrihaspati, the Guru or religious adviser of the gods, who found the
moon with his wife. The holy man was just returning from his bath in
the Ganges, and he threw his dripping loin-cloth at the moon, which
produced the spots. In Upper India, again, little children are taught
to call the moon M&acirc;m&ucirc; or &ldquo;maternal uncle,&rdquo; and
the dark spots are said to represent an old woman who sits there
working her spinning-wheel.</p>
<p>The moon has one special function in connection with disease. One of
his titles is Oshadhipati or &ldquo;lord of the medicinal
plants.&rdquo; Hence comes the idea that roots and simples, and in
particular those that are to be used for any magical or mystic purpose,
should be collected by moonlight. Thus in Shakespeare Jessica
says,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted
herbs</p>
<p class="line">That did renew old Aeson.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And Laertes speaks of the poison &ldquo;collected from
all simples that have virtue under the moon.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e649src" href="#xd21e649" name="xd21e649src">29</a> Hence the
belief that the moon has a sympathetic influence over vegetation.
Tusser<a class="noteref" id="xd21e652src" href="#xd21e652" name=
"xd21e652src">30</a> advised the peasant,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Sow peason and beans, in the wane of the
moon.</p>
<p class="line">Who soweth them sooner, he soweth too soon;</p>
<p class="line">That they with the planet may rest and arise,</p>
<p class="line">And flourish, with bearing most plentiful
wise.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The same rule applies all over Northern India, and the
phases of the moon exercise an important influence on all agricultural
operations.</p>
<p>Based on the same principle is the custom of drinking the moon.
Among Muhammadans in Oudh, &ldquo;a silver basin being filled with
water, is held in such a situation that the full moon may be reflected
in it. The person to be benefited by the draught is required to look
steadfastly on the moon in the basin, then shut his eyes and quaff the
liquid at a draught. This remedy is advised by medical professors in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>nervous cases, and also for palpitation of the
heart.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e670src" href="#xd21e670" name=
"xd21e670src">31</a> Somewhat similar customs prevail among Hindus in
Northern India. At the full moon of the month Ku&acirc;r
(September-October) people lay out food on the house-tops, and when it
has absorbed the rays of the moon they distribute it among their
relations; this is supposed to lengthen life. On the same night girls
pour out water in the moonlight, and say that they are pouring out the
cold weather, which was hidden in the water jar. The habit of making
patients look at the moon in ghi, oil, or milk is common, and is said
to be specially efficacious for leprosy and similar diseases.</p>
<p>There is now little special worship of Soma or Chandra, and when an
image is erected to him it is generally associated with that of
S&ucirc;rya. In the old ritual Anumati or the moon just short of full
was specially worshipped in connection with the Manes. The full-moon
day was provided with a special goddess, R&acirc;k&acirc;. Nowadays the
phases largely influence the domestic ritual. All over the world we
find the idea that anything done or suffered by man on a waxing moon
tends to develop, whereas anything done or suffered on a waning moon
tends to diminish. Thus a popular trick charm for warts is to look at
the new moon, lift some dust from under the left foot, rub the wart
with it, and as the moon wanes the wart dies.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e675src" href="#xd21e675" name="xd21e675src">32</a> It is on the
days of the new and full moon that spirits are most numerous and
active. The Code of Manu directs that ceremonies are to be performed at
the conjunction and opposition of the moon.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e678src" href="#xd21e678" name="xd21e678src">33</a> Among the Jews
it would seem that the full moon was prescribed for national
celebrations, while those of a domestic character took place at the new
moon; there is some evidence to show that this may be connected with
the habit of pastoral nations performing journeys in the cool moonlight
nights.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e681src" href="#xd21e681" name=

<p class="first">and Aubrey of the Yorkshire maids who &ldquo;doe

prayer&mdash;&ldquo;O Moon! Leave us as well as you found
us!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e704src" href="#xd21e704" name=
"xd21e704src">36</a> It is a common practice in Europe to turn a piece
of silver, which being white is the lunar metal, when the new moon is
first seen. So Hindus at the first sight of the new moon hold one end
of their turbans in their hands, take from it seven threads, present
them to the moon with a prayer, and then exchange the compliments of
the season. In Bombay<a class="noteref" id="xd21e707src" href=
"#xd21e707" name="xd21e707src">37</a> on all new moon days
Br&acirc;hmans offer oblations of water and sesamum seed to their
ancestors, and those who are Agnihotris and do the fire sacrifice
kindle the sacred fire on all new and full moon days. Musalm&acirc;ns
on the new moon which comes after the new year sprinkle the blood of a
goat beside the house door. In Bombay a young Musalm&acirc;n girl will
not go out at the new moon or on a Thursday, apparently because this is
the time that evil spirits roam abroad. In Upper India the houses of
the pious are freely plastered with a mixture of earth and cow-dung,
and no animal is yoked.</p>
<p>A curious idea applies to the new moon of Bh&acirc;don (August).
Whoever looks at the moon on this day will be the victim of false
accusations during the following year. The only way to avoid this is to
perform a sort of penance by getting someone to shy brickbats at your
house, which at other times is regarded as an extreme form of insult
and degradation. There is a regular festival held for this purpose at
Benares on the fourth day of Bh&acirc;don (August), which is known as
the Dhela Chauth Mela, or &ldquo;the clod festival of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>fourth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e714src"
href="#xd21e714" name="xd21e714src">38</a> We shall come across later
on other examples of the principle that to court abuse under certain
circumstances is a means of propitiating the spirits of evil and
avoiding danger from them. This is probably the origin of the practice
in Orissa&mdash;&ldquo;On the Khurda estate the peasants give a curious
reason for the absence of garden cultivation and fruit trees, which
form a salient feature in that part of the country. In our own
districts every homestead has its little ring of vegetable ground. But
in Khurda one seldom meets with these green spots except in
Br&acirc;hman villages. The common cultivators say that from time
immemorial they considered it lucky at a certain festival for a man to
be annoyed and abused by his neighbours. With a view to giving ample
cause of offence they mutilate the fruit trees and trample the gardens
of their neighbours, and so court fortune by bringing down the wrath of
the injured owner.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e717src" href=
"#xd21e717" name="xd21e717src">39</a> We shall see that this is one
probable explanation of the indecency which prevails at the Hol&icirc;
festival.</p>
<p>Moon-worship appears to be more popular in Bih&acirc;r and Bengal
than in the North-West Provinces or the Panj&acirc;b.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e722src" href="#xd21e722" name="xd21e722src">40</a> The fourth
day of the waxing moon in the month of Bh&acirc;don is sacred to the
moon and known as Chauk Chanda. It is very unlucky to look at the moon
on that day, as whoever does so will make his name infamous. The story
runs that Takshaka, the king of the snakes, stole the ear-rings of King
Aditi, who, being unable to discover the thief, laid it to the charge
of Krishna, whose thefts of milk and cream from the <span class="corr"
id="xd21e725" title="Source: Gopis">Gop&icirc;s</span> had made him
sufficiently notorious. Krishna, mortified at this false accusation,
recovered and restored the ear-ring, and as this was the day on which
Krishna was wrongfully disgraced, the moon of that night is invested
with associations of special sinfulness. Some people fast and in the
evening eat only rice and curds. Br&acirc;hmans worship the moon with
offerings of flowers and sweetmeats, and people <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>get
stones thrown at their houses, as further west on the day of the Dhela
Chauth. On this day schoolboys visit their friends and make a peculiar
noise by knocking together two coloured sticks, like castanets.</p>
<p>One idea lying at the base of much of the respect paid to the moon
is that it is the abode of the Pitri or sainted dead. This is a theory
which is the common property of many primitive races.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e732src" href="#xd21e732" name="xd21e732src">41</a> The
explanation probably is that the soul of the dead man rises with the
smoke of the funeral pyre, and hence the realm of Yama would naturally
be fixed in the moon. This seems to be the reason why the early Indian
Buddhists worshipped the moon. At the new moon the monks bathed and
shaved each other; and at a special service the duties of a monk were
recited. On full moon days they dined at the houses of laymen. On that
night a platform was raised in the preaching hall. The superior
brethren chanted the law, and the people greeted the name of Buddha
with shouts of &ldquo;S&acirc;dhu&rdquo; or &ldquo;the holy
one.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e735src" href="#xd21e735" name=

<h3 class="main">Eclipses and the Fire Sacrifice.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hindus, like other primitive races, have their eclipse
demons. &ldquo;When once the practice of bringing down the moon had
become familiar to the primitive Greek, who saw it done at sacred
marriages and other rites, he was provided with an explanation of lunar
eclipses; some other fellow was bringing down the moon for his private
ends. And at the present day in Greece the proper way to stop a lunar
eclipse is to call out &lsquo;I see you!&rsquo; and thus make the
worker of this deed of darkness desist. So completely did this theory,
which we must regard as peculiarly Greek, establish itself in ancient
Greece, that strange to say, not a trace of the earlier primitive
theory, according to which some monster swallows the eclipsed moon, is
to be found in classical Greek <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>literature, unless the beating
of metal instruments to frighten away the monster be a survival of the
primitive practice.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e745src" href=
"#xd21e745" name="xd21e745src">43</a></p>
<p>In India, however, this earlier explanation of the phenomena of
eclipses flourishes in full vigour. The eclipse demon, R&acirc;hu,
whose name means &ldquo;the looser&rdquo; or &ldquo;the seizer,&rdquo;
was one of the Asuras or demons. When the gods produced the Amrita, or
nectar, from the churned ocean, he disguised himself like one of them
and drank a portion of it. The sun and moon detected his fraud and
informed Vishnu, who severed the head and two of the arms of R&acirc;hu
from the trunk. The portion of nectar which he had drunk secured his
immortality; the head and tail were transferred to the solar sphere,
the head wreaking its vengeance on the sun and moon by occasionally
swallowing them, while the tail, under the name of Ketu, gave birth to
a numerous progeny of comets and fiery meteors. By another legend Ketu
was turned into the demon Sainhikeya and the Arunah Ketavah or
&ldquo;Red apparitions,&rdquo; which often appear in the older
folk-lore.</p>
<p>Ketu nowadays is only a vague demon of disease, and R&acirc;hu too
has suffered a grievous degradation. He is now the special godling of
the Dus&acirc;dhs and Dh&acirc;ngars, two menial tribes found in the
Eastern districts of the North-Western Provinces. His worship is a kind
of fire sacrifice. A ditch seven cubits long and one and a quarter
cubits broad (both numbers of mystical significance) is dug and filled
with burning faggots, which are allowed to smoulder into cinders. One
of the tribal priests in a state of religious afflatus walks through
the fire, into which some oil or butter is poured to make a sudden
blaze. It is said that the sacred fire is harmless; but some admit that
a certain preservative ointment is used by the performers. The
worshippers insist on the priest coming in actual contact with the
flames, and a case occurred some years ago in Gorakhpur when one of the
priests was degraded on account of his perfunctory discharge of this
sacred duty. The same rule applies to the priest who performs the rites
at the lighting of the Hol&icirc; fire. It is needless <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>to say
that similar rites prevail elsewhere, chiefly in Southern
India.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e754src" href="#xd21e754" name=
"xd21e754src">44</a></p>
<p>In connection with this rite of fire-walking they have another
function in which a ladder is made of wooden sword-blades, up which the
priest is compelled to climb, resting the soles of his feet on the
edges of the weapons. When he reaches the top he decapitates a white
cock which is tied to the summit of the ladder. This kind of victim is,
as we have already seen, appropriate to propitiate the Sun godling, and
there can be little doubt that the main object of this form of
symbolical magic is to appease the deities which control the rain and
harvests.</p>
<p>Br&acirc;hmans so far join in this low-caste worship as to perform
the fire sacrifice (<i>homa</i>) near the trench where the ceremony is
being performed. In Mirzapur one of the songs recited on this occasion
runs: &ldquo;O devotee! How many cubits long is the trench which thou
hast dug? How many maunds of butter hast thou poured upon it that the
fire billows rise in the air? Seven cubits long is the trench; seven
maunds of firewood hast thou placed within it. One and a quarter maunds
of firewood hast thou placed within it. One and a quarter maunds of
butter hast thou poured into the trench that the fire billows rise to
the sky.&rdquo; All this is based on the idea that fire is a scarer of
demons, a theory which widely prevails. The Romans made their flocks
and herds pass through fire, over which they leaped themselves. In
Ireland, when the St. John&rsquo;s Eve fire has burnt low, &ldquo;the
young men strip to the waist and leap over or through the flames, and
he who braves the greatest blaze is considered the victor over the
powers of evil.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e764src" href=
"#xd21e764" name="xd21e764src">45</a></p>
<p>By a curious process of anthropomorphism, another legend makes
R&acirc;h or R&acirc;hu, the Dus&acirc;dh godling, to have been not an
eclipse demon, but the ghost of an ancient <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>leader
of the tribe who was killed in battle.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e777src" href="#xd21e777" name="xd21e777src">46</a> A still
grosser theory of eclipses is found in the belief held by the Ghasiyas
of Mirzapur that the sun and moon once borrowed money from some of the
Dom tribe and did not pay it back. Now in revenge a Dom occasionally
devours them and vomits them up again when the eclipse is over.</p>

"xd21e785src">47</a> &ldquo;These late eclipses in the sun and moon
portend no good to us; though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus
and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects; love
cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide; in cities mutinies; in
countries discord; in palaces treason; and the bond cracked
&rsquo;twixt son and father.&rdquo; The Hindu authority<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e788src" href="#xd21e788" name="xd21e788src">48</a>
writes much to the same effect. &ldquo;Eclipses usually portend or
cause grief; but if rain without unusual symptoms fall within a week of
the eclipse, all baneful influences come to nought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among high-caste Hindus no food which has remained in the house
during an eclipse of the sun or moon can be eaten; it must be given
away, and all earthen vessels in use in the house at the time must be
broken. Mr. Conway<a class="noteref" id="xd21e793src" href="#xd21e793"
name="xd21e793src">49</a> takes this to mean that &ldquo;the eclipse
was to have his attention called by outcries and prayers to the fact
that if it was fire he needed there was plenty on earth; and if food,
he might have all in the house, provided he would consent to satisfy
his appetite with articles of food less important than the luminaries
of heaven.&rdquo; The observance is more probably based on the idea of
ceremonial pollution caused by the actual working of demoniacal
agency.</p>
<p>Food is particularly liable to this form of pollution. The wise
housewife, when an eclipse is announced, takes a leaf of the
Tulas&icirc; or sacred basil, and sprinkling Ganges water on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>it, puts the leaf in the jars containing the
drinking water for the use of the family and the cooked food, and thus
keeps them pure while the eclipse is going on. Confectioners, who are
obliged to keep large quantities of cooked food ready, relieve
themselves and their customers from the taboo by keeping some of the
sacred Kusa or D&ucirc;b grass in their vessels when an eclipse is
expected. A pregnant woman will do no work during an eclipse, as
otherwise she believes that her child would be deformed, and the
deformity is supposed to bear some relation to the work which is being
done by her at the time. Thus, if she were to sew anything, the baby
would have a hole in its flesh, generally near the ear; if she cut
anything, the child would have a hare-lip. On the same principle the
horns of pregnant cattle are smeared with red paint during an eclipse,
because red is a colour abhorred by demons. While the eclipse is going
on, drinking water, eating food, and all household business, as well as
the worship of the gods, are all prohibited. No respectable Hindu will
at such a time sleep on a bedstead or lie down to rest, and he will
give alms in barley or copper coins to relieve the pain of the
suffering luminaries.</p>
<p>So among Muhammadans,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e802src" href=
"#xd21e802" name="xd21e802src">50</a> a bride-elect sends offerings of
intercession (<i>sadqa</i>) to her intended husband, accompanied by a
goat or kid, which must be tied to his bedstead during the continuance
of the eclipse. These offerings are afterwards distributed in charity.
Women expecting to be mothers are carefully kept awake, as they believe
that the security of the coming infant depends on the mother being kept
from sleep. They are not allowed to use a needle, scissors, knife, or
any other instrument for fear of drawing blood, which at that time
would be injurious to both mother and child.</p>
<p>But among Hindus the most effectual means of scaring the demon and
releasing the afflicted planet is to bathe in some sacred stream. At
this time a Br&acirc;hman should stand in the water beside the
worshipper and recite the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. At an eclipse of the
moon it is advisable to bathe at Benares, and when the sun is eclipsed
at Kurukshetra. Bernier<a class="noteref" id="xd21e810src" href=
"#xd21e810" name="xd21e810src">51</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>gives a very curious
account of the bathing which he witnessed at Delhi during the great
eclipse of 1666. In the lower Him&acirc;layas the current ritual
prescribes an elaborate ceremony, when numerous articles are placed in
the sacred water jar; the image of the snake god, stamped in silver, is
worshipped, and the usual gifts are made.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e815src" href="#xd21e815" name="xd21e815src">52</a></p>
<p>In Lad&acirc;kh ram horns are fixed on the stems of fruit trees as a
propitiatory offering at the time of an eclipse, and trees thus
honoured are believed to bear an unfailing crop of the choicest
fruit.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e820src" href="#xd21e820" name=
"xd21e820src">53</a></p>
<p>Another effectual means of scaring the demon is by music and noise,
of which we shall find instances later on. &ldquo;The Irish and Welsh,
during eclipses, run about beating kettles and pans, thinking their
clamour and vexations available to the assistance of the higher
orbs.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e825src" href="#xd21e825" name=
"xd21e825src">54</a> So in India, women go about with brass pans and
beat them to drive R&acirc;hu from his prey.</p>
<p>Of course, the time of an eclipse is most inauspicious for the
commencement of any important business. Here again the learned Aubrey
confirms the current Hindu belief. &ldquo;According to the rules of
astrology,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it is not good to undertake any
business of importance in the new moon or at an eclipse.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Star-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The worship of the other constellations is much less
important than those of the greater luminaries which we have been
discussing. The Hindu names nine constellations, known as Nava-graha,
&ldquo;the nine seizers,&rdquo; specially in reference to R&acirc;hu,
which grips the sun and moon in eclipses, and more generally in the
astrological sense of influencing the destinies of men. These nine
stars are the sun (S&ucirc;rya), the moon (Soma, Chandra), the
ascending and descending nodes (R&acirc;hu, Ketu), and the five
planets&mdash;Mercury (Budha), Venus (Sukra), Mars (Mangala,
Ang&acirc;raka), Jupiter (Vrihaspati), <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>and Saturn (Sani). This
group of nine stars is worshipped at marriages and other important
religious rites. Of the signs of the Zodiac (<i>r&acirc;si-chakra</i>)
the rural Hindu knows little more than the names&mdash;Mesha (Aries),
Vrisha (Taurus), Mithuna (Gemini), Karka (Cancer), Sinha (Leo), Kanya
(Virgo), Tula (Libra), Vrischika (Scorpio), Dhanu (Sagittarius), Makara
(Capricornus), Kumbha (Aquarius), and M&icirc;na (Pisces). Practically
the only direct influence they exercise over his life is that from the
opening R&acirc;si or sign in which he is born the first letter of the
secret name which he bears is selected. Still less concern has he with
the asterisms or Nakshatra, a word which has been variously interpreted
to mean &ldquo;coming or ascending,&rdquo; &ldquo;night
guardians,&rdquo; or &ldquo;undecaying.&rdquo; As already stated, they
are said to have been the twenty-seven daughters of the Rishi Daksha,
and wives of Soma or the moon. The usual enumeration gives
twenty-eight, and they are vaguely supposed to represent certain stars
or constellations, but the identification of these is very uncertain.
One list, with some of the corresponding stars, gives Sravishth&acirc;
or Dhanishth&acirc; (Delphinus), Sata-bhishaj (Aquarius), P&ucirc;rva
Bh&acirc;drapad&acirc;, Uttara Bh&acirc;drapad&acirc;, Revat&icirc;,
Asvin&icirc; (Aries), Bharan&icirc; (Musca), Krittik&acirc; (the
Pleiades), Rohin&icirc; (Aldebaran), Mriga-siras (Orion),
&Acirc;rdr&acirc;, Punarvas&ucirc;, Pushya, &Acirc;slesh&acirc;,
Magh&acirc; (Leo), P&ucirc;rv&acirc;-Phalgun&icirc;, Uttara
Phalgun&icirc;, Hasta (Corvus), Chitr&acirc; (Spica Virginis),
Sv&acirc;t&icirc; (Arcturus), Vis&acirc;kha (Libra),
Anur&acirc;dh&acirc;, Jyeshth&acirc;, M&ucirc;la, P&ucirc;rva
&Acirc;sh&acirc;dh&acirc;, Uttara &Acirc;sh&acirc;dh&acirc;, Abhijit
(Lyra), and Sravana. These are used only in calculating the marriage
horoscope, and the only one of them with which the fairly well-to-do
rustic has much concern is with the unlucky M&ucirc;la. Should by an
evil chance his son be born in this asterism, he has to undergo a most
elaborate rite of purification.</p>
<p>Others stars have their legends. The Riksha or constellation of the
Great Bear represents the seven deified Rishis&mdash;Gautama,
Bh&acirc;radwaja, Viswamitra, Jamadagni, Vashishtha, Kasyapa and Atri.
Dhruva, the Pole Star, was the grandson of Manu Swayambhuva, and was
driven from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>his home by his step-mother. He, though a
Kshatriya, joined the company of the Rishis and was finally raised to
the skies as Grahadh&acirc;ra, &ldquo;the pivot of the plants.&rdquo;
So Canopus is the Rishi Agastya who was perhaps one of the early Aryan
missionaries to Southern India and won a place in heaven by his piety.
Orion is Mrigasiras, the head of Brahma in the form of a stag which was
struck off by Siva when the deity attempted violence to his own
daughter Sandhy&acirc;, the twilight. Krittik&acirc; or the Pleiades
represent the six nurses of K&acirc;rttikeya, the god of war.</p>
<p>Part of the purificatory rite for a woman after her delivery is to
bring her out at night and let her look at the stars, while her husband
stands over her with a bludgeon to guard her from the assaults of
demons. One interesting survival of the old mythology is that in Upper
India women are fond of teaching their children that the stars are kine
and the moon their shepherd, an idea which has formed the basis of much
of the speculations of a school of comparative mythology now almost
completely discredited.</p>

M&acirc;t&acirc; or Dhart&icirc; M&acirc;&icirc;, a name which means
&ldquo;the upholder&rdquo; or &ldquo;supporter.&rdquo; She is
distinguished from Bh&ucirc;mi, &ldquo;the soil,&rdquo; which, as we

mother of all things, an idea common to all folk-lore. The myth of
Dyaus, the sky, and Prithiv&icirc;, the earth, once joined and now

mutilation of Uranus by Cronus and other tales of a most distinctively
savage type.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e866src" href="#xd21e866" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Worship of Mother Earth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The worship of Mother Earth assumes many varied forms.
The pious Hindu does reverence to her as he rises from his bed in the
morning; and even the indifferent follows his example when he begins to
plough and sow. In the Panj&acirc;b,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e878src"
href="#xd21e878" name="xd21e878src">57</a> &ldquo;when a cow or buffalo
is first bought, or when she first gives milk after calving, the first
five streams of milk drawn from her are allowed to fall on the ground
in honour of the goddess, and every time of milking the first stream is
so treated. So, when medicine is taken, a little is sprinkled in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>her honour.&rdquo; On the same principle the great
Kublai Kh&acirc;n used to sprinkle the milk of his mares on the ground.
&ldquo;This is done,&rdquo; says Marco Polo,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e883src" href="#xd21e883" name="xd21e883src">58</a> &ldquo;on the
injunction of the idolaters and idol priests, who say that it is an
excellent thing to sprinkle milk on the ground every 28th of August, so
that the earth and the air and the false gods shall have their share of
it, and the spirits likewise that inhabit the air and the earth, and
those beings will protect and bless the Kaan and his children, and his
wives, and his folk and his gear, and his cattle and his horses, and
all that is his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same feeling is also shown in the primitive taboo, which forbids
that any holy thing, such as the blood of a tribesman, should fall upon
the ground. Thus we are told that Kublai Kh&acirc;n ordered his captive
Nayan &ldquo;to be wrapped in a carpet and tossed to and fro so
mercilessly that he died, and the Kaan caused him to be put to death in
this way, because he would not have the blood of his Line Imperial
spilt upon the ground, and exposed to the eye of heaven and before the
sun.&rdquo; Even some savages when they are obliged to shed the blood
of a member of the tribe, as at the rite of circumcision, receive it
upon their own bodies. The soul, in fact, is supposed to be in the
blood, and any ground on which the blood falls becomes taboo or
accursed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e888src" href="#xd21e888" name=
"xd21e888src">59</a></p>
<p>Throughout Northern India the belief in the sanctity of the earth is
universal. The dying man is laid on the earth at the moment of
dissolution, and so is the mother at the time of parturition. In the
case of the dying there is perhaps another influence at work in this
precaution, the idea that the soul must not be barred by roof or wall,
and allowed to wing its course unimpeded to the place reserved for
it.</p>
<p>In the eastern districts of the North-Western Provinces there is a
regular rite common to all the inferior castes that a few days before a
wedding the women go in procession to the village clay-pit and fetch
from there the sacred earth (<i>matmangara</i>), which is used in
making the marriage altar and the fireplace on which the wedding feast
is cooked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>There are various elements in the ritual which
point to a very primitive origin. Thus, one part of the proceedings is
that a Cham&acirc;r, one of the non-Aryan castes, leads the procession,
beating his drum the whole time to scare demons. When the earth has
been collected the drum is worshipped and smeared with red lead. There
can be little doubt that the drum was one of the very primitive
fetishes of the aboriginal races. One, and perhaps about the most
primitive, form of it is the Damaru or drum shaped like an hour-glass
which accompanies Siva, and next to this comes the M&acirc;ndar, the
sides of which are formed out of earthenware, and which is the first
stage in the development of a musical instrument from a vessel covered
with some substance which resounds when beaten. This latter form of
drum is the national musical instrument of the Central Indian Gonds and
their brethren. The Cham&acirc;r, again, digs the earth with an
affectation of secrecy, which, as we shall see, is indispensable in
rites of this class. The mother of the bride or bridegroom veils
herself with her sheet, and the digger passes the earth over his left
shoulder to a virgin who stands behind him and receives it in a corner
of her robe.</p>
<p>Dust, again, which has been trodden on has mystic powers. In the
villages you may see little children after an elephant has passed
patting the marks of his feet in the dust and singing a song. Among the
Kunbis of Kol&acirc;ba, when the women neighbours come to inspect a
newly-born child, they touch the soles of the mother&rsquo;s feet, as
if picking some dust off them, wave it over the child, and blow the
dust particularly into the air and partly over the baby.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e902src" href="#xd21e902" name="xd21e902src">60</a>
In Th&acirc;na, when a mother goes out with a young child on her hip,
if she cannot get lamp-black to rub between its eyes, she takes dust
off her left foot and rubs it on the child&rsquo;s forehead.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e905src" href="#xd21e905" name="xd21e905src">61</a>
So we read of the Isle of Man&mdash;&ldquo;If a person endowed with the
Evil Eye has just passed by a farmer&rsquo;s herd of cattle, and a calf
has suddenly been seized with a serious illness, the farmer hurries
after the man with the Evil Eye to get the dust from under his feet. If
he objects, he may, as has sometimes been very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>unceremoniously done, throw him down by force,
take off his shoes and scrape off the dust adhering to their soles, and
carry it back to throw over the calf. Even that is not always
necessary, as it appears to be quite enough if he takes up dust where
he of the Evil Eye has just trod.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e910src" href="#xd21e910" name="xd21e910src">62</a></p>
<p>Earth, again, is regarded as a remedy for disease. I have seen
people in Ireland take a pinch of earth from the grave of a priest
noted for his piety, and drink it dissolved in water. People suffering
from a certain class of disease come to the tomb of the Saint Kadri at
Yemnur in Dharw&acirc;r and smear their bodies with mud that they may
be cured of the disease.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e915src" href=
"#xd21e915" name="xd21e915src">63</a> There are numerous instances of
the use of earth as a poultice and an application for the cure of
wounds and sores among the savage tribes of Africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is on much the same principle that among some tribes in India
Mother Earth is worshipped as a Kuladevat&acirc; or household goddess
and appealed to in times of danger. The Hindu troopers at the battle of
K&acirc;mpti, at the crisis of the engagement, took dust from their
grooms and threw it over their heads. At S&ucirc;rat in 1640, in fear
of drought, Br&acirc;hmans went about carrying a board with earth on it
on their heads.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e920src" href="#xd21e920"
name="xd21e920src">64</a> So wrestlers, when they are about to engage
in a contest, rub earth on their arms and legs and roll on the ground.
As in the classical legend of Antaeus, they believe that they derive
strength from the touch of Mother Earth.</p>
<p>The same principle, also, appears to be at the bottom of many
<span class="corr" id="xd21e925" title=
"Source: similiar">similar</span> practices. Thus the Hindu always uses
earth to purify his cooking vessels, which he regards with peculiar
respect. Mourners of the Jaina creed on going home after a funeral rub
their hands with earth and water to remove the death impurity. In his
daily bath the pious Hindu rubs a little Ganges mud on his body. The
P&acirc;rsis cover the parings of their hair and nails with a little
earth so that demons may not enter into them. The Muhammadan uses earth
for the purpose of purification when water is not procurable. For the
same reason the ascetic rubs his body with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>dust and
ashes, which, as we shall see, is a potent scarer of demons. Though
here there is possibly another theory at work at the same time. The
practice was common to the Greek as well as to the barbarian mysteries,
and according to Mr. Lang, &ldquo;the idea clearly was that by cleaning
away the filth plastered over the body was symbolized the pure and free
condition of the initiate.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e930src"
href="#xd21e930" name="xd21e930src">65</a></p>
<p>Lastly, it is perhaps on the same principle that many universal
burial customs have originated. The Muhammadan phrase for burial is
<i>matt&icirc;-den&acirc;</i>, &ldquo;to give earth.&rdquo; The
unburied mariner asks Horace for the gift of a little earth. We
ourselves consider it a pious duty to throw a little earth on the
coffin of a departed friend. The same custom prevails among many Hindu
tribes. The Chambh&acirc;rs of P&ucirc;na throw handfuls of earth over
the corpse; so do the Hal&acirc;l-khors; the Ling&acirc;yats of
Dharw&acirc;r follow the same practice. The Bani Isr&acirc;ils at a
funeral stuff a handful of earth into a pillow which is put under the
head of the corpse.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e938src" href="#xd21e938"
name="xd21e938src">66</a> The same conception was probably the basis of
the universal custom of funeral oblations. Even nowadays in Scotland
all the milk in the house is poured on the ground at a death, and the
same custom is familiar through many Hebrew and Homeric instances. The
same idea appears in the custom prevalent in the Middle Ages in
Germany, that when a nun renounced the world and became civilly dead
her relations threw dust on her arms.<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the Dr&acirc;vidian races of Central India
earth-worship prevails widely. In Chota N&acirc;gpur the Or&acirc;ons
celebrate in spring the marriage of the earth. The Dryad of the
S&acirc;l tree (<i>Shorea robusta</i>), who controls the rain, is
propitiated with a sacrifice of fowls. Flowers of the S&acirc;l tree
are taken to the village and carried round from house to house in a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>basket. The women wash the feet of the priest and
do obeisance to him. He dances with them and puts some flowers upon
them and upon the house. They first douse him with water as a means of
bringing the rain, and then refresh him with beer.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e954src" href="#xd21e954" name="xd21e954src">68</a></p>
<p>In Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d, when the sowing is over, its completion
is celebrated by the Machandr&icirc; P&ucirc;j&acirc;, or worship of
Mother Earth, a ceremony intended to invoke fertility. &ldquo;Every
cultivator does the worship himself, with his family, servants, etc.;
no Br&acirc;hman need join in it. At the edge of one of his fields
intended for the spring harvest, he puts up a little semicircle or
three-sided wall of clods about a foot high, meant to represent a hut.
This is covered over with green K&acirc;ns grass (<i>Imperata
spontanea</i>) to represent thatch. At the two ends of the hut two
posts of Pal&acirc;sa wood (<i>Butea frondosa</i>) are erected, with
leaves round the head like those which are put up at marriage. They are
tied to the thatch with red thread. In the centre of this little house,
which is the temple of Machandr&icirc;, or Mother Earth, a little fire
is made, and milk placed on it to boil in a tiny earthen pot. It is
allowed to boil over as a sign of abundance. While this is going on,
the ploughmen, who are all collected in a field, drive their bullocks
at a trot, striking them wildly; it is the end of the year&rsquo;s
labour for the cattle. The cultivator meanwhile offers a little rice,
molasses, and saffron to Machandr&icirc;, and then makes two tiny holes
in the ground to represent granaries; he drops a few grains in and
covers them over; this is a symbol of prayer, that his granary may be
filled from the produce of the land.&rdquo; Similar instances of
symbolical magic will constantly occur in connection with similar
rites. Then he puts a little saffron on the foreheads of the ploughman
and the bullocks, and ties a red thread round the horns of the cattle.
The animals are then let go, and the ploughmen run off at full speed
across country, scattering wheat boiled whole as a sign of abundance.
This concludes the rite, and every one returns home.<a class="noteref"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=

<p>Many similar usages prevail among the jungle tribes of South
Mirzapur. The Korwas consider Dhart&icirc; M&acirc;t&acirc; one of
their chief godlings. She lives in the village in the Deoh&acirc;r or
general village shrine under a S&acirc;l tree. In the month of Aghan
(November&ndash;December) she is worshipped with flowers and the
offering of a goat. When she is duly worshipped the crops prosper and
there are no epidemics. The Pat&acirc;ris and Majhw&acirc;rs also
recognize her as a goddess, and worship her in the month of S&acirc;wan
(August). The local devil priest or Baiga offers to her a goat, cock,
and rich cakes (<i>p&ucirc;ri</i>). She is also worshipped in the cold
weather before the grain and barley are sown, and again on the
threshing-floor before the winnowing begins. The flesh of the animals
is consumed by the males and unmarried girls; no grown-up girl or
married woman is allowed to touch the flesh. The Ghasiyas also believe
in Dhart&icirc; M&acirc;t&acirc;. She is their village goddess, and is
presented with a ram or a goat or cakes. The offering is made by the
Baiga, for whom the materials are provided by a general contribution in
the village. The Kharw&acirc;rs worship her at the village shrine
before wood-cutting and ploughing begin. In the month of S&acirc;wan
(August) they do a special service in her honour, known as the
Hariy&acirc;r&icirc; P&ucirc;j&acirc;, or &ldquo;worship of
greenery,&rdquo; at the time of transplanting the rice. In Aghan
(November) they do the Khar P&ucirc;j&acirc;, when they begin cutting
thatching-grass (<i>khar</i>). A cock, some Mahua (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Bassia latifolia</i>) and parched grain are offered to her.
All this is done by the Baiga, who receives the offerings, and none but
males are allowed to attend. Similarly the Pankas worship her before
sowing and harvesting the grain. They and the Bhuiy&acirc;rs offer a
pig and some liquor at the more important agricultural seasons. The
Kharw&acirc;rs sometimes call her Dev&icirc; D&acirc;&icirc;, or
&ldquo;Nurse Dev&icirc;,&rdquo; and in times of trouble sprinkle rice
and pulse in her name on the ground. When the crops are being sown they
release a fowl as a scapegoat and pray&mdash;<i lang="hi-latn">H&ecirc;

<h3 class="main">Thunder and Lightning.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As is natural, thunder and lightning are considered
ill-omened. In the old mythology lightning (<i>vidyut</i>) was one of
the weapons of the Maruts, and Parjanya was the deity who wielded the
thunderbolt. Many legends tell that the soul of the first man came to
earth in the form of the lightning. Thus Yama was the first man born of
the thunderbolt, and he first trod the path of death and became regent
of the dead. Many are the devices to scare the lightning demon.
&ldquo;During a thunderstorm it was a Greek custom to put out the fire,
and hiss and cheep with the lips. The reason for the custom was
explained by the Pythagoreans to be that by acting thus you scared the
spirits in Tartarus, who were doubtless supposed to make the thunder
and lightning. Similarly some of the Australian blacks, who attribute
thunder to the agency of demons, and are much afraid of it, believe
that they can dispel it by chanting some particular words and breathing
hard; and it is a German superstition that the danger from a
thunderstorm can be averted by putting out the fire. During a
thunderstorm the Sakai of the Malay Peninsula run out of their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>houses and brandish their weapons to drive away
the demons; and the Esthonians in Russia fasten scythes, edge upwards,
over the door, that the demons, fleeing from the thundering god, may
cut their feet if they try to seek shelter in the house. Sometimes the
Esthonians, for a similar purpose, take all the edged tools in the
house and throw them out into the yard. It is said that when the
thunder is over, spots of blood are often found on the scythes and
knives, showing that the demons have been wounded by them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So when the Indians of Canada were asked by the Jesuit
missionaries why they planted their swords in the ground point upwards,
they replied that the spirit of the thunder was sensible, and that if
he saw the naked blades he would turn away and take good care not to
approach their huts. This is a fair example of the close similarity of
European superstitions to the superstitions of savages. In the present
case the difference happens to be slightly in favour of the Indians,
since they did not, like our European savages, delude themselves into
seeing the blood of demons on the swords. The reason for the Greek and
German custom of putting out the fire during a thunderstorm is probably
a wish to avoid attracting the attention of the thunder demons. From a
like motive some of the Australian blacks hide themselves during a
thunderstorm, and keep absolutely silent, lest the thunder should find
them out. Once during a storm a white man called out in a loud voice to
a black fellow, with whom he was working, to put the saw under a log
and seek shelter. He found that the saw had been already put aside, and
the black fellow was very indignant at his master for speaking so loud.
&lsquo;What for,&rsquo; said he, in great wrath&mdash;&lsquo;what for
speak so loud? Now um thunder hear and know where um saw is.&rsquo; And
he went out and changed its hiding-place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>All these precautions are well known to the people of Upper India.
It is a very common habit to throw out axes and knives to scare the
thunder demon, as we shall see is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>the case with the evil spirit of
hail. The rule of keeping quiet and muttering incantations under the
breath is also familiar to them. They are particularly careful lest a
first-born son may lean against anything and thus attract the demon on
himself. Thunder in a clear sky is much dreaded, an idea which often
appears in classical literature.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1021src"

<p class="first">Earthquakes are also naturally an object of terror.
Pythagoras believed that they were caused by dead men fighting beneath
the earth. The common explanation of these occurrences in India is that
Var&acirc;ha, or the boar incarnation of Vishnu, who supports the
earth, is changing the burden of the world from one tusk to another. By
another account it is due to the great bull or elephant which supports
the world. Derived from a more advanced theological stage is the theory
that the earth shakes because it is over-burdened by the sins of
mankind in this evil age. Colonel Dalton describes how a rumbling
(probably caused by an earthquake) in the cave in which the
bloodthirsty divinity of the Korwas was supposed to dwell, caused
extreme terror among them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1029src" href=

<h3 class="main">River-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">High on the list of benevolent deities of Northern
India are the great rivers, especially the Ganges and the Jumn&acirc;,
which are known respectively as Gang&acirc; M&acirc;&icirc; or
&ldquo;Mother Ganges&rdquo; and Jumn&acirc; j&icirc; or &ldquo;Lady
Jumn&acirc;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gang&acirc;, of course, in the mythologies has a divine origin.
According to one account she flows from the toe of Vishnu, and was
brought down from heaven by the incantations of the Saint
Bh&acirc;g&icirc;ratha, to purify the ashes of the sixty thousand sons
of King S&acirc;gara, who had been burnt up by the angry glance of
Kapila, the sage. By another story she <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>descends in seven streams
from Siva&rsquo;s brow. The descent of Gang&acirc; disturbed the Saint
Jahnu at his austerities, and in his anger he drank up the stream; but
he finally relented, and allowed the river to flow from his ear. By a
third account she is the daughter of Himavat, the impersonation of the
Him&acirc;layan range. Another curious tale, which must have been based
on some Indian tradition, is found in Plutarch<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1041src" href="#xd21e1041" name=
"xd21e1041src">74</a>&mdash;&ldquo;The Ganges is a river of India,
called so for the following reason:&mdash;The nymph Kalauria bore to
Indus a son of notable beauty, by name Ganges, who in the ignorance of
intoxication had connection with his mother. But when later on he
learned the truth from his nurse, in the passion of his remorse he
threw himself into the river Chliaros, which was called Ganges after
him.&rdquo; Another legend again is found in the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1044src" href=
"#xd21e1044" name="xd21e1044src">75</a> The wise Santanu goes to hunt
on the banks of the Ganges and finds a lovely nymph, of whom he becomes
enamoured. She puts him under the taboo that he is never to say
anything to displease her, an idea familiar in the well-known Swan
Maiden cycle of folk-tales. She bears him eight sons, of whom she
throws seven into the river, and her husband dares not remonstrate with
her. When she is about to throw away the last child he challenges her
to tell him who she is and to have pity upon him. She then tells him
that she is Gang&acirc; personified, and that the seven sons are the
divine Vasavas, who by being thrown into the river are liberated from
the curse of human life. The eighth remains among men as Dyaus, the
sky, in the form of the eunuch Bh&icirc;shma.</p>

<p class="figureHead">GANGES WATER BEARERS.</p>
</div>
<p>It is remarkable that, as in Plutarch&rsquo;s legend, the
Jumn&acirc; is connected with a tale of incest. Yam&icirc; or
Yamun&acirc; was the daughter of the Sun and sister of Yama, the god of
death. They were the first human pair and the progenitors of the race
of men. It is needless to say that similar traditions of brother and
sister marriage are found in Egypt, Peru and elsewhere. Yamun&acirc;,
according to the modern story told on her banks, was unmarried, and
hence some people will not drink from her because she was not purified
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>by the marriage rite, and so the water is heavy
and indigestible. Another tale tells how Balar&acirc;ma, in a state of
inebriety, called upon her to come to him that he might bathe in her
waters; and as she did not heed, he, in his rage, seized his
ploughshare weapon, dragged her to him, and compelled her to follow him
whithersoever he wandered through the forest. The river then assumed a
human form and besought his forgiveness; but it was some time before
she could appease the angry hero. This has been taken to represent the
construction of some ancient canal from the river; but Mr. Growse shows
that this idea is incorrect.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1056src" href=
"#xd21e1056" name="xd21e1056src">76</a></p>
<p>The worship of Mother Ganges is comparatively modern. She is
mentioned only twice in the Rig Veda, and then without any emphasis or
complementary epithet. Apparently at this time the so-called Aryan
invaders had not reached her banks.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1061src"
href="#xd21e1061" name="xd21e1061src">77</a> There are numerous temples
to Gang&acirc; all along her banks, of which those at Hardw&acirc;r,
Garhmuktesar, Soron, Mathura, Pray&acirc;g, and Benares are perhaps the
most important in Upper India. She has her special festival on the
seventh of the month of Bais&acirc;kh (May-June), which is celebrated
by general bathing all along the banks of the sacred stream. Ganges
water is carried long distances into the interior, and is highly valued
for its use in sacrifices, as a remedy, a form of stringent oath, and a
viaticum for the dying. The water of certain holy wells in
Scotland<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1064src" href="#xd21e1064" name=
"xd21e1064src">78</a> and elsewhere enjoys a similar value.</p>
<p>But it is by bathing in the sacred stream at the full moon, during
eclipses, and on special festivals that the greatest efficacy is
assured. On these occasions an opportunity is taken for making
oblations to the sainted dead whose ashes have been consigned to her
waters. Bathing is throughout India regarded as one of the chief means
of religious advancement. The idea rests on a metaphor&mdash;as the
body is cleansed from physical pollution, so the soul is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>purified
from sin. The stock case of the merit of this religious bathing is that
of King Trisanku, &ldquo;he who had committed the three deadly
sins,&rdquo; who is also known as Satyavrata. The legend appears in
various forms. By one story he tried to win his way to heaven by a
great sacrifice which his priest, Vasishtha, declined to perform. He
then applied to Visvamitra, the rival Levite, who agreed to assist him.
He was opposed by the sons of Vasishtha, whom he consumed to ashes.
Finally, Trisanku was admitted to heaven, but he was forced by the
angry saint to hang for ever with his head downwards. By another
account he committed the deadly sins of running away with the wife of a
citizen, offending his father, and killing in a time of famine
K&acirc;madhenu, the wondrous cow of Vashishtha. By another story he
killed a cow and a Br&acirc;hman and married his step-mother. At any
rate he and the wicked R&acirc;ja Vena were the types of violent
sinners in the early legends; possibly they represent a revolt against
the pretensions of the Br&acirc;hmans. At length the sage Visvamitra
took pity upon him, and having collected water from all the sacred
places in the world, washed him clean of his offences.</p>

<p class="first">When two sacred rivers combine their waters the
junction (<i>Sangama</i>) is regarded as of peculiar sanctity.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=

Jumn&acirc; at Pray&acirc;g, the modern Allah&acirc;b&acirc;d, which is
presided over by the guardian deity Veni M&acirc;dhava. The same
virtue, but in a lesser degree, attaches to the junction of the Ganges
and the Son or Gandak. In the Him&acirc;layas cairns are raised at the
junction of three streams, and every passer-by adds a stone. At the
confluence of the Gaula and Baliya rivers in the Hills there is said to
be a house of gold, but unfortunately it is at present invisible on
account of some potent enchantment.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1092src"
href="#xd21e1092" name="xd21e1092src">81</a> Bathing in such rivers is
not only a propitiation for sin, but is also efficacious for the cure
of disease. Even the wicked R&acirc;ja Vena, who was, as we have seen,
a type of old-world impiety, was cured, like Naaman the Syrian, of his
leprosy by bathing in the S&acirc;raswati, the lost river of the Indian
desert.</p>
<p>Even minor streams have their sanctity and their legends. The course
of the Sarju was opened by a Rishi, from which time dates the efficacy
of a pilgrimage to B&acirc;gheswar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1097src"
href="#xd21e1097" name="xd21e1097src">82</a> R&acirc;ja Rantideva was
such a pious king and offered up so many cattle in sacrifice, that his
blood formed the river Chambal. Anas&ucirc;y&acirc;, the wife of Atri,
was a daughter of the Rishi Daksha. She did penance for ten thousand
years, and so was enabled to create the river Mand&acirc;kin&icirc;,
and thus saved the land from famine. Her worship is localized at
Ansuyaji in the B&acirc;nda District. The sacred portion of the Phalgu
is said occasionally to flow with milk, though Dr. Buchanan was not
fortunate enough to meet anyone who professed to have witnessed the
occurrence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1103src" href="#xd21e1103" name=
"xd21e1103src">83</a> The Narmad&acirc; was wooed by the river Son, who
proved faithless to her, and was beguiled by the Johil&acirc;, a rival
lady stream, who acted the part of the barber&rsquo;s wife at the
wedding. The Narmad&acirc;, enraged at her lover&rsquo;s perfidy, tore
her way through the marble rocks at Jabalpur, and has worn the willow
ever since.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1108src" href="#xd21e1108" name=

While in the case of the latter only the Northern (or as it is called
the K&acirc;si or Benares bank) is efficacious for bathing or for the
cremation of the dead, the Narmad&acirc; is free from any restriction
of the kind. The same is the case with the Son, at least during its
course through the District of Mirzapur. By some the sanctity of the
Narmad&acirc; is regarded as superior even to that of the Ganges. While
according to some authorities it is necessary to bathe in the Ganges in
order to obtain forgiveness of sins, the same result is attained by
mere contemplation of the Narmad&acirc;. According to the
Bh&acirc;vishya Pur&acirc;na the sanctity of the Ganges will cease on
the expiration of five thousand years of the Kali Yuga, or the fourth
age of the world, which occurred in 1895, and the Narmad&acirc; will
take its place. The Ganges priests, however, repudiate this calumny,
and it may safely be assumed that Mother Ganges will not abandon her
primacy in the religious world of Hinduism without a determined
struggle.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1113src" href="#xd21e1113" name=

<h3 class="main">Ill-omened Streams.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But all rivers are not beneficent. Worst of all is the
dread Vaitaran&icirc;, the river of death, which is localized in Orissa
and pours its stream of ordure and blood on the confines of the realm
of Yama. Woe to the wretch who in that dread hour lacks the aid of the
Br&acirc;hman and the holy cow to help him to the other shore. The name
of one stream is accursed in the ears of all Hindus, the hateful
Karamn&acirc;sa, which flows for part of its course through the
Mirzapur District. Even to touch it destroys the merit of works of
piety, for such is the popular interpretation of its name. No plausible
reason for the evil reputation of this particular stream has been
suggested except that it may have been in early times the frontier
between the invading Aryans and the aborigines, and possibly the scene
of a campaign in which the latter were victorious. The Karam&acirc;
tree is, however, the totem of the Dr&acirc;vidian Kharw&acirc;rs and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>M&acirc;njhis, who live along its banks, and it is
perhaps possible that this may be the real origin of the name, and that
its association with good works (<i>karma</i>) was an afterthought.</p>
<p>The legend of this ill-omened stream is associated with that of the
wicked king Trisanku, to whom reference has already been made. When the
sage Visvamitra collected water from all the sacred streams of the
world, it fell burdened with the monarch&rsquo;s sins into the
Karamn&acirc;sa, which has remained defiled ever since. By another
account, the sinner was hung up between heaven and earth as a
punishment for his offences, and from his body drips a baneful moisture
which still pollutes the water. Similar legends of the origin of rivers
are not wanting in folk-lore. An Austrian story tells that all rivers
take their origin from the tears shed by a giant&rsquo;s wife as she
laments his death.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1128src" href=
"#xd21e1128" name="xd21e1128src">86</a> The same idea of a river

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Origin of River-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is perhaps worth considering the possible origin of
this river-worship. Far from being peculiar to Hinduism, it is common
to the whole Aryan world. The prayer of the patient Odysseus<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1139src" href="#xd21e1139" name=
"xd21e1139src">88</a> to the river after his sufferings in the deep is
heard in almost the same language at every bathing Gh&acirc;t in Upper
India, from the source of Mother Ganges to where she joins the ocean.
The river is always flowing, always being replenished by its tributary
streams, and hence comes to be regarded as a thing of life, an emblem
of eternal existence, a benevolent spirit which washes away the sins of
humanity and supplies in a tropical land the chief needs of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>men. In a thirsty land the mighty stream of the
Ganges would naturally arouse feelings of respect and adoration, not so
much perhaps to those living on its banks and ever blessed by its
kindly influence, as to the travel-worn pilgrim from the sandy steppes
of R&acirc;jasth&acirc;n or the waterless valleys of the Central Indian
hills. We can hardly doubt that from this point of view Mother Ganges
has been a potent factor in the spread of Hinduism. She became the
handmaid of the only real civilization of which Hindust&acirc;n could
boast, and from her shrines bands of eager missionaries were ever
starting to sow the seeds of the worship of the gods in the lands of
the unbeliever.</p>
<p>The two great rivers of Upper India were, again, associated with
that land of fable and mystery, the snowy range which was the home of
the gods and the refuge of countless saints and mystics, who in its
solitudes worked out the enigma of the world for the modern Hindu. They
ended in the great ocean, the final home of the ashes of the sainted
dead. Even the partially Hinduised Dr&acirc;vidian tribes of the
Vindhyan Plateau bring the bones of their dead relations to mingle with
those of the congregation of the faithful, who have found their final
rest in its waters since the world was young. The Ganges and the
streams which swell its flood thus come to be associated with the
deepest beliefs of the race, and it is hard to exaggerate its influence
as a bond of union between the nondescript entities which go to make up
modern Hinduism.</p>
<p>Again, much of the worship of rivers is connected with the
propitiation of the water-snakes, demons and goblins, with which in
popular belief many of them are infested. Such were K&acirc;liy&acirc;,
the great black serpent of the Jumn&acirc;, which attacked the infant
Krishna; the serpent King of Nep&acirc;l, Karkotaka, who dwelt in the
lake N&acirc;gar&acirc;sa when the divine lotus of Adi Buddha floated
on its surface.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1148src" href="#xd21e1148"

accident.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1153src" href="#xd21e1153" name=
"xd21e1153src">90</a> These malignant water demons naturally infest
dangerous rapids and whirlpools, and it is necessary to propitiate
them. Thus we learn that on the river T&acirc;pti in Ber&acirc;r timber
floated down sometimes disappears in a subterraneous cavity; so before
trying the navigation there the Gonds sacrifice a goat to propitiate
the river demon.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1156src" href="#xd21e1156"
name="xd21e1156src">91</a></p>
<p>Another variety of these demons of water is the N&acirc;ga and his
wife the N&acirc;gin, of whom we shall hear more in connection with
snake-worship. In the Sikandar, a tributary of the Son, is a deep
water-hole where no one dares to go. The water is said to reach down as
far as P&acirc;t&acirc;la, or the infernal regions. Here live the
N&acirc;ga and the N&acirc;gin. In the middle of the river is a tree of
the Ku&acirc;lo variety, and when ghosts trouble the neighbourhood an
experienced Ojha or sorcerer is called, who bores holes in the bark of
the tree and there shuts up the noxious ghosts, which then come under
the rule of the N&acirc;ga and N&acirc;gin, who are the supreme rulers
of the ghostly band.</p>
<p>Another Mirzapur river, the Karsa, is infested by a Deo, or demon,
known as Jata Rohini, or &ldquo;Rohini of the matted locks.&rdquo; He
is worshipped by the Baiga priest to ensure abundant rain and harvests
and to keep off disease. The Baiga catches a fish which he presents to
the Deo, but if any one but a Baiga dares to drink there, the water
bubbles up and the demon sweeps him away.</p>
<p>Like this Deo of Mirzapur, most of these water demons are malignant
and wait until some wretched creature enters their domains, when they
seize and drag him away. Some of them can even catch the reflection of
a person as he looks into water, and hence savages all over the world
are very averse to looking into deep water-holes. Thus, the Zulus
believe that there is a beast in the water which can seize the shadow
of a man, and men are forbidden to lean over and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>look
into a deep pool, lest their shadow should be taken away. There is a
tale of the Godiva cycle in which a woman at Arles is carried off by a
creature called a Drac and made to act as nurse to the demon&rsquo;s
child.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1167src" href="#xd21e1167" name=
"xd21e1167src">92</a> In Scotland water-holes are known as &ldquo;the
cups of the fairies.&rdquo; And there is the Trinity well in Ireland,
into which no one can gaze with impunity, and from which the river
Boyne once burst forth in pursuit of a lady who had insulted
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1170src" href="#xd21e1170" name=
"xd21e1170src">93</a></p>
<p>In India, also, dangerous creatures of this kind abound. There is in
Mirzapur a famous water-hole, known as Barewa. A herdsman was once
grazing his buffaloes near the place, when the waters rose in anger and
carried off him and his cattle. Nowadays the drowned buffaloes have
taken the shape of a dangerous demon known as Bhains&acirc;sura, or the
buffalo demon, who now in company with the N&acirc;ga and the
N&acirc;gin lives in this place, and no one dares to fish there until
he has propitiated the demons with the offering of a fowl, eggs, and a
goat. Another kind of water demon attacks fishermen; it appears in the
form of a turban which fixes itself to his hook and increases in length
as he tries to drag it to the shore.</p>
<p>There is, again, the water-horse, with whom we are familiar in the
&ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; where he consorts with mares of mortal
race. This creature is known in Kashm&icirc;r as the Zalgur.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1177src" href="#xd21e1177" name=
"xd21e1177src">94</a> The water-bull of Manxland is a creature of the
same class, and they constantly appear through the whole range of
Celtic folk-lore.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1180src" href="#xd21e1180"
name="xd21e1180src">95</a> Such again is the Hydra of Greek mythology,
and the Teutonic Nikke or Nixy, who has originated the legend of the
Flying Dutchman, and in the shape of Old Nick is the terror of sailors.
Like him is the Kelpie of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=
"#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>Scotland, a water-horse who is
believed to carry off the unwary by sudden floods and devour them. Of
the same kindred is the last of the dragons which St. Patrick chained
up in a lake on the Galtee Mountains in Tipperary.</p>
<p>Many pools, again, in Northern India are infested by a creature
known as the B&ucirc;rna, who is the ghost of a drowned person. He is
always on the look-out for someone to take his place, so he drags in
people who come to fish in his domains.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1187src" href="#xd21e1187" name="xd21e1187src">96</a> He is
particularly feared by the Magahiya Doms, a caste of degraded nomadic
gipsies who infest Gorakhpur and Beh&acirc;r.</p>
<p>Many of these demons, such as the N&acirc;ga and N&acirc;gin, have
kingdoms and palaces stored with treasure under the water, and there
they entice young men and maidens, who occasionally come back to their
mortal kindred and tell them of the wonders which they have seen. These
are akin to Morgan la Fay of the Orlando Innamorato, La Motte
Fouqu&eacute;&rsquo;s Undine, and they often merge into the mermaid of
the Swan Maiden type of tale, who marries a mortal lover and leaves him
at last because in his folly he breaks some taboo which is a condition
of the permanence of their love.</p>
<p>But besides these dragons which infest rivers and lakes there are
special water gods, many of which are the primitive water monster in a
developed form. Such is Mahish&acirc;sura, who is the Mahishoba of
Ber&acirc;r, and like the Bhains&acirc;sura already mentioned, infests
great rivers and demands propitiation. According to the early mythology
this Mahisha, the buffalo demon, was killed by K&acirc;rttikeya at the
Krauncha pass in the Him&acirc;laya, which was opened by the god to
make a passage for the deities to visit the plains from Kail&acirc;sa.
The Kols, again, have N&acirc;ga Era, who presides over tanks, wells,
and any stagnant water, and Garha Era, the river goddess.
&ldquo;They,&rdquo; as Col. Dalton remarks, &ldquo;are frequently and
very truly denounced as the cause of sickness and propitiated with
sacrifices to spare their victims.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Floods and Drowning People.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Floods are, as we have seen, regarded as produced by
demoniacal agency. In the Panj&acirc;b, when a village is in danger of
floods, the headman makes an offering of a cocoa-nut and a rupee to the
flood demon. As in many other places the cocoa-nut represents the head
of a human victim, which in olden times was the proper offering. He
holds the offering in his hand and stands in the water. When the flood
rises high enough to wash the offering from his hand, it is believed
that the waters will abate. Some people throw seven handfuls of boiled
wheat and sugar into the stream and distribute the remainder among the
persons present. Some take a male buffalo, a horse, or a ram, and after
boring the right ear of the victim, throw it into the water. If the
victim be a horse, it should be saddled before it is offered. A short
time ago, when the town and temples at Hardw&acirc;r were in imminent
danger during the Gohna flood, the Br&acirc;hmans poured vessels of
milk, rice and flowers into the waters of Mother Ganges and prayed to
her to spare them.</p>
<p>In the same connection may be noticed the very common prejudice
which exists in India against saving drowning people. This is familiar
in Western folk-lore. It is supposed to be alluded to in the
&ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; of Shakespeare, and the plot of Sir W.
Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pirate&rdquo; turns upon it. Numerous instances of
the same idea have been collected by Dr. Tylor and Mr. Conway.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1210src" href="#xd21e1210" name=
"xd21e1210src">98</a> Dr. Tylor considers that it is based upon the
belief that to snatch a victim from the very clutches of the water
spirit is a rash defiance of the deity which would hardly pass
unavenged. Mr. Black<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1213src" href=
"#xd21e1213" name="xd21e1213src">99</a> accounts for the idea on the
ground that the spirits of people who have died a violent death may
return to earth if they can find a substitute; hence the soul of the
last dead man is insulted or injured by anyone preventing another from
taking his place. This last theory is very common in Western folk-lore.
Thus Lady Wilde writes from Ireland<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1216src"
href="#xd21e1216" name="xd21e1216src">100</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;It is
believed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>that the spirit of the dead last buried has to
watch in the churchyard until another corpse is laid there, or to
perform menial offices in the spirit world, such as carrying wood and
water, till the next spirit comes from earth. They are also sent on
messages to earth, chiefly to announce the coming death of some
relative, and at this they are glad, for their own time of peace and
rest will come at last.&rdquo; So in Argyllshire,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1221src" href="#xd21e1221" name="xd21e1221src">101</a> it was
believed that the spirit of the last interred kept watch around the
churchyard until the arrival of another occupant, to whom its custody
was transmitted. This, as we shall see in connection with the custom of
barring the return of the ghost, quite agrees with popular feeling in
India, and furnishes an adequate explanation of the prejudice against
rescuing the drowning and incurring the wrath of the former ghost, who
is thus deprived of the chance of release by making over his functions
to a substitute.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Khw&acirc;ja Khizr, the God of Water.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But besides these water spirits and local river gods,
the Hindus have a special god of water, Khw&acirc;ja Khizr, whose
Muhammadan title has been Hinduised into R&acirc;ja Kid&acirc;r, or as
he is called in Bengal, K&acirc;waj or P&icirc;r Badr. This is a good
instance of a fact, which will be separately discussed elsewhere, that
the Hindus are always ready to annex the deities and beliefs of other
races.</p>
<p>According to the Sikandarn&acirc;ma, Khw&acirc;ja Khizr was a saint
of Isl&acirc;m, who presided over the well of immortality, and directed
Alexander of Macedon in his vain search for the blessed waters. The
fish is his vehicle, and hence its image is painted over the doors of
both Hindus and Muhammadans, while it became the family crest of the
late royal house of Oudh. Among Muhammadans a prayer is said to
Khw&acirc;ja Khizr at the first shaving of a boy, and a little boat is
launched in a river or tank in his honour. The same rite is performed
at the close of the rainy season, when it is supposed to have some
connection with the saint Ilisha, that is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>to say the prophet
Elisha. Elisha, by the way, apparently from the miraculous way in which
his bones revived the dead, has come down in modern times to Italy as a
worker of miracles, and is known to the Tuscan peasant as
Elisaeus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1234src" href="#xd21e1234" name=
"xd21e1234src">102</a></p>
<p>Another legend represents Khw&acirc;ja Khizr to be of the family of
Noah, who is also regarded by rural Muhammadans as a water deity in
connection with the flood. Others connect him with St. George, the
patron saint of England, who is the Ghergis of Syria, and according to
Muhammadan tradition was sent in the time of the Prophet to convert the
King of Maushil, and came to life after three successive martyrdoms.
Others identify him with Thammuz, Tauz, or Adonis. Others call him the
companion of Moses, and the commentator Husain says he was a general in
the army of Zu&rsquo;l Qarnain, &ldquo;he of the horns,&rdquo; or
Alexander the Great.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1239src" href=
"#xd21e1239" name="xd21e1239src">103</a></p>
<p>Out of this jumble of all the mythologies has been evolved the Hindu
god of water, the patron deity of boatmen, who is invoked by them to
prevent their boats from being broken or submerged, or to show them the
way when they have lost it. He is worshipped by burning lamps, feeding
Br&acirc;hmans, and by setting afloat on a village pond a little raft
of grass with a lighted lamp placed upon it. This, it may be noted, is
one of the many ways in which the demon of evil or disease is sent away
in many parts of the world.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1244src" href=
"#xd21e1244" name="xd21e1244src">104</a> Another curious function is,
in popular belief, allotted to Khw&acirc;ja Khizr, that of haunting
markets in the early morning and fixing the rates of grain, which he
also protects from the Evil Eye.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1247src"

<h3 class="main">The Folk-lore of Wells.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this connection some of the folk-lore of wells may
be mentioned. The digging of a well is a duty requiring infinite
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>care and caution. The work should begin on Sunday,
and on the previous Saturday night little bowls of water are placed
round the proposed site, and the one which dries up least marks the
best site for the well, which reminds us of the fleece of Gideon. The
circumference is then marked and they commence to dig, leaving the
central lump of earth intact. They cut out this clod of earth last and
in the Panj&acirc;b call it Khw&acirc;jaj&icirc;, perhaps after
Khw&acirc;ja Khizr, the water god, worship it and feed Br&acirc;hmans.
If it breaks it is a bad omen, and a new site will be selected a week
afterwards. Further east when a man intends to sink a well he inquires
from the Pandit an auspicious moment for commencing the work. When that
hour comes he worships Gaur&icirc;, Ganesa, Sesha N&acirc;ga, the world
serpent, the earth, the spade and the nine planets. Then facing in the
direction in which, according to the directions of the Pandit, Sesha
N&acirc;ga is supposed to be lying at the time, he cuts five clods with
the spade. When the workmen reach the point at which the wooden
well-curb has to be fixed, the owner smears the curb in five places
with red powder, and tying D&ucirc;b grass and a sacred thread to it,
lowers it into its place. A fire sacrifice is done, and Br&acirc;hmans
are fed. When the well is ready, cow-dung, milk, cow urine, butter and
Ganges water, leaves of the sacred Tulas&icirc; and honey are thrown in
before the water is used.</p>
<p>But no well is considered lucky until the S&acirc;lagr&acirc;ma, or
spiral ammonite sacred to Vishnu, is solemnly wedded to the
Tulas&icirc; or basil plant, representing the garden which the well is
intended to water. The rite is done according to the standard marriage
formula: the relations are assembled; the owner of the garden
represents the bridegroom, while a kinsman of his wife stands for the
bride. Gifts are given to Br&acirc;hmans, a feast is held in the
garden, and both it and the well may then be used without danger. All
this is on the same lines as many of the emblematical marriage rites
which in other places are intended to promote the growth of
vegetation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1259src" href="#xd21e1259" name=
"xd21e1259src">106</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Sirsa they have a legend that long ago, in time of drought, a
headman of a village went to a Faq&icirc;r to beg him to pray for rain,
and promised him his daughter in marriage if his prayer was successful.
The rain came, but the headman would not perform his promise, and the
Faq&icirc;r cursed the land, so that all the water became brackish. But
he so far relented as to permit sweet water to flow on condition that
it was given to all men free of cost. In one village the spring became
at once brackish when a water-rate was levied, and turned sweet again
when the tax was remitted. In another the brackish water became sweet
at the intercession of a Faq&icirc;r. In the Panj&acirc;b there is a
class of Faq&icirc;rs who are known as S&ucirc;nga, or
&ldquo;sniffers,&rdquo; because they can smell out sweet water
underground. They work on much the same lines as their brethren in
England, who discover springs by means of the divining rod.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1265src" href="#xd21e1265" name=
"xd21e1265src">107</a> In one of the tales of Somadeva we have a doll
which can produce water at will, which is like Lucian&rsquo;s story of
the pestle that was sent to fetch water. When the Egyptian sorcerer was
away his pupil tried to perform the trick, but he did not know the
charm for making the water stop, and the house was flooded. Then he
chopped the pestle in two, but that only made matters worse, for both
halves set to bring the water. This is somewhat like the magic quern of
European folk-lore.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1268src" href=

<p>The water of many wells is efficacious in the cure of disease. In
Ireland, the first water drawn from a sacred well after midnight on May
Eve is considered an effective antidote to witchcraft.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1273src" href="#xd21e1273" name=
"xd21e1273src">109</a> In India many wells have a reputation for curing
barrenness, which is universally regarded as a disease, the work of
supernatural agency. In India the water of seven wells is collected on
the night of the Diw&acirc;l&icirc;, or feast of lamps, and barren
women bathe in it as a means of procuring children. In a well in Orissa
the priests throw betel-nuts into the mud, and barren women scramble
for them. Those who find them will have their desire for <span class=

gratified before long.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1278src" href=
"#xd21e1278" name="xd21e1278src">110</a> For the same reason, after
childbirth the mother is taken to worship the village well. She walks
round it in the course of the sun and smears the platform with red
lead, which is probably a survival of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1281" title="Source: orginal">original</span> rite of blood
sacrifice. In Dharw&acirc;r the child of a Br&acirc;hman is taken in
the third month to worship water at the village well.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1284src" href="#xd21e1284" name="xd21e1284src">111</a> In
Pal&acirc;mau the S&acirc;rhul feast is observed in the month of
Bais&acirc;kh (May), when dancing and singing goes on and the headmen
entertain their tenants. The whole village is purified, and then they
proceed to the village well, which is cleaned out, while the village
Baiga does a sacrifice and every one smears the platform with red lead.
No one may draw water from the well during the S&acirc;rhul.<a class=

"xd21e1288src">112</a> Hydrophobia all over Northern India is cured by
looking down seven wells in succession.</p>
<p>In the Panj&acirc;b the sites of deserted wells are discovered by
driving about a herd of goats, which are supposed to lie down at the
place where search should be made. Some people discover wells by
dreams; others, as the Luniyas, a caste of navvies, are said, like the
Faq&icirc;rs in Sirsa, to be able to discover by smell where water is
likely to be found. I was once shown a well in the Muzaffarnagar
district into which a Faq&icirc;r once spat, and for a long time after
the visit of the holy man it ran with excellent milk. The supply had
ceased, I regret to say, before my visit. The well of life which can
survive even the ashes of a corpse is found throughout the Indian
folk-tales.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1293src" href="#xd21e1293" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sacred wells, of course, abound all over the country.
Many of them are supposed to have underground connection with the
Ganges or some other holy river. Many of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

the wanderings of R&acirc;ma and S&icirc;t&acirc; after their exile
from Ayodhya. S&icirc;t&acirc;&rsquo;s kitchen (S&icirc;t&acirc;
k&icirc; raso&icirc;) is shown in various places, as at Kanauj and
Deoriya in the Allah&acirc;b&acirc;d District.<a class="noteref" id=

is on the Bindh&acirc;chal hill in Mirzapur, and is a famous resort of
pilgrims. There is another near Monghyr, and a third in the
Sult&acirc;npur District in Oudh. The Monghyr well has been provided
with a special legend. S&icirc;t&acirc; was suspected of faithlessness
during her captivity in the kingdom of R&acirc;vana. She threw herself
into a pit filled with fire, where the hot spring now flows, and came
out purified. When Dr. Buchanan visited the place they had just
invented a new legend in connection with it. Shortly before, it was
said, the water became so cool as to allow bathing in it. The governor
prohibited the practice, as it made the water so dirty that Europeans
could not drink it. &ldquo;But on the very day when the bricklayers
began to build a wall in order to exclude the bathers, the water became
so hot that no one could dare to touch it, so that the precaution being
unnecessary, the work of the infidels was abandoned.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1306src" href="#xd21e1306" name=
"xd21e1306src">115</a></p>
<p>At Benares are the Manikarnika well, which was produced by an
ear-ring of Siva falling into it, and the Jn&acirc;nav&acirc;pi, to
drink of which brings wisdom. The well at Sihor in
R&acirc;jput&acirc;na is sacred to Gautama, and is considered
efficacious in the cure of various disorders. At Sarkuhiya in the Basti
District is a well where Buddha struck the ground with his arrow and
caused water to flow, as Moses did from the rock. There are, again,
many wells which give omens. In the Middle Ages people used to resort
to the fountain of Baranta in the Forest of Breclieu and fling water
from a tankard on a stone close by, an act which was followed by
thunder, lightning and rain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1311src" href=
"#xd21e1311" name="xd21e1311src">116</a> At a Cornish well people used
to go and inquire about absent friends. If the person &ldquo;be living
and in health, the still, quiet waters of the well pit will instantly
bubble or boil up as a pot of clear, crystalline water; if sick, foul
and puddled water; if dead, it will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53"

alter its colour or stillness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1316src" href="#xd21e1316" name="xd21e1316src">117</a> Many other
instances of the same fact might be given. So in Kashm&icirc;r, in one
well water rushes out when a sheep or goat is sacrificed; another runs
if the ninth of any month happen to fall on Friday; in a third, those
who have any special needs throw in a nut; if it floats, it is
considered an omen of success; if it sinks, it is considered adverse.
At Askot, in the Him&acirc;laya, there is a holy well which is used for
divination of the prospects of the harvest. If the spring in a given
time fills the brass vessel to the brim into which the water falls,
there will be a good season; if only a little water comes, drought may
be expected.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1319src" href="#xd21e1319"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Waterfalls, naturally uncommon in the flat country of
Upper India, are, as might have been expected, regarded with
veneration, and the deity of the fall is carefully propitiated. The
visitor to the magnificent waterfall in which the river Chandraprabha
pours its waters over a sheer precipice three hundred feet high in its
descent from the Vindhyan plateau to the Gangetic valley, will learn

offspring. On a rock beside the fall they lay a simple offering

<h3 class="main">Sacred Lakes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are also numerous lakes which are considered
sacred and visited by pilgrims. Such is Pushkar, or Pokhar, the lake
<i>par excellence</i>, in R&acirc;jput&acirc;na. One theory of the
sanctity of this lake is that it was originally a natural depression
and enlarged at a subsequent date by supernatural agency. &ldquo;Every
Hindu family of note has its niche for purposes of devotion. Here is
the only temple in India sacred to Brahma, the Creator. While he was
creating the world he kindled the sacred fire; but his wife
Sawantar&icirc; was nowhere to be found, and as without a woman the
rites could not proceed, a G&ucirc;jar girl took her place.
Sawantar&icirc; on her return was so enraged at the indignity that she
retired to the height close by, known as Ratnagir&icirc;, or &lsquo;the
hill of gems,&rsquo; where she disappeared. On this spot a fountain
gushed out, still called by her name, close to which is her shrine, not
the least attractive in the precincts of Pokhar.&rdquo; Like many of
these lakes, such as are known in Great Britain as the Devil&rsquo;s
Punch-bowls, Pokhar has its dragon legend, and one of the rocks near
the lake is known as N&acirc;gpah&acirc;r, or &ldquo;Dragon
Hill.&rdquo; There is a similar legend attached to the Lon&acirc;r Lake
in Ber&acirc;r, which was then the den of the giant Lon&acirc;sura,
whom Vishnu destroyed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1348src" href=
"#xd21e1348" name="xd21e1348src">121</a></p>
<p>Most famous of all the lakes is M&acirc;na Sarovara in Tibet, about
which many legends are told. &ldquo;The lake of M&acirc;na Sarovara was
formed from the mind of Brahma, and thence derived its name. There
dwell also Mah&acirc;deva and the gods, and thence flow the Sarj&ucirc;
and other female rivers, and the Satadru (Satlaj) and other male
rivers. When the earth of M&acirc;na Sarovara touches any one&rsquo;s
body, or when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>any one bathes therein, he shall go to the
Paradise of Brahma; and he who drinks its waters shall go to the Heaven
of Siva, and shall be released from the sins of a hundred births; and
even the beast which bears the name of M&acirc;na Sarovara shall go to
the Paradise of Brahma.&rdquo; It is said that the sons of Brahma,
Marichi, Vasishtha and the rest of the sages proceeded to the north of
Him&acirc;laya and performed austerities on Mount Kail&acirc;sa, where
they saw Siva and P&acirc;rvat&icirc; and remained for twelve years
absorbed in meditation and prayer. There was very little rain and water
was scanty. In their distress they appealed to Brahma. He asked them
what their wishes might be. The Rishis replied, &ldquo;We are absorbed
in devotion on Kail&acirc;sa, and must always go thence to bathe in the
Mand&acirc;kin&icirc; river; make a place for us to bathe in.&rdquo;
Then Brahma, by a mental effort, formed the holy lake of M&acirc;nasa,
and the Rishis worshipped the golden Linga which rose from the midst of
the waters of the lake.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1355src" href=
"#xd21e1355" name="xd21e1355src">122</a></p>
<p>So the Nain&icirc; T&acirc;l Lake is sacred to K&acirc;l&icirc; in
one of her numerous forms. The goddess Sambr&acirc;, the tutelary deity
of the Chauh&acirc;n R&acirc;jputs, converted a dense forest into a
plain of gold and silver. But they, dreading the strife which such a
possession would excite, begged the goddess to retract her gift, and
she gave them the present lake of salt.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1360src" href="#xd21e1360" name="xd21e1360src">123</a> The people
say that the Kat&ucirc;r valley was once a great lake where lived a
R&acirc;kshasa named R&acirc;na who used to devour the inhabitants of
the neighbouring villages. Indra&rsquo;s elephant Air&acirc;vata
descended to earth at the place now known after him by the name
H&acirc;thi Ch&icirc;na, and with his mighty tusks he burst the
embankment of the lake and the water flowed away, so that the goddess
Bhrawar&icirc;, whose shrine is there to this day, was enabled to
destroy the monster.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Lake of the Fairy Gifts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Ch&acirc;nda District of the Central Provinces
is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>lake of Taroba or Tadala, which is connected with
an interesting series of folk-lore legends. A marriage procession was
once passing the place, and, finding no water, a strange old man
suggested that the bride and bridegroom should join in digging for a
spring. They laughingly consented, and after removing a little earth a
clear fountain gushed forth. As they were all drinking with delight the
waters rose, and spreading over the land, overwhelmed the married pair.
&ldquo;But fairy hands soon constructed a temple in the depths, where
the spirits of the drowned are supposed to dwell. Afterwards, on the
lake side, a palm tree grew up, which appeared only during the day,
sinking into the earth at twilight. One day a rash pilgrim seated
himself on the tree and was borne into the skies, where the flames of
the sun consumed him.&rdquo; This part of the story reads like a
genuine solar myth. &ldquo;The palm tree then shrivelled away into
dust, and in its place appeared an image of the spirit of the lake,
which is worshipped under the name of Taroba, or &lsquo;the palm-tree
deity.&rsquo; Formerly, at the call of pilgrims, all necessary vessels
rose from the lake, and after being washed were returned to the waters.
But an evil-minded man at last took those he had received to his house,
and from that day the mystic provision wholly ceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This legend of the fairy gifts which are lost through the selfish
greed of some mean-spirited man has been admirably illustrated by Mr.
Hartland. It is also told of the Amner Lake in Elichpur, of the Karsota
Lake in Mirzapur, and of many other places.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1372src" href="#xd21e1372" name="xd21e1372src">124</a></p>
<p>Many of these lakes possess subaqueous palaces beneath their waters.
At Cudden Point in Cornwall, the unhallowed revelry of a party of
roisterers is heard from under the waves.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1377src" href="#xd21e1377" name="xd21e1377src">125</a> In one of
Somadeva&rsquo;s stories the hero dives after a lady, and comes on a
splendid temple of Siva; Sattvasila falls into the sea and finds a city
with palaces of gold, supported on pillars of jewels; Yasahketu plunges
into the sea and finds a city gleaming with palaces that had bright
pillars of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>precious stone, walls flashing with gold, and
latticed windows of pearl. So in the sixth fable of the second chapter
of the Hitopadesa, the hero dives into the water and sees a princess
seated on a couch in a palace of gold, waited on by youthful sylphs.
The sage Mandakarni alarmed the gods by his austerities, and Indra sent
five of his fairies to beguile him. They succeeded, and now dwell in a
house beneath the waters of the lake called from them Panchapsaras. At
the Lake of Taroba, the tale of which has been already told, on quiet
nights the country people hear faint sounds of drum and trumpet passing
round the lake, and old men say that in one dry year when the waters
sank low, golden pinnacles of a fairy temple were seen glittering in
the depths. This is exactly the legend of Lough Neagh, immortalized by
Thomas Moore.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Sh&acirc;hgarh Lake.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A lake at Sh&acirc;hgarh in the Bareilly District is
the seat of another legend which appears widely in folk-lore. When
R&acirc;ja Vena ruled the land, he, like Buddha, struck by the
inequality of human life, retired with his young wife Sundar&icirc; or
Ketak&icirc; to live like a peasant. One day she went to the lake to
draw water, and she had naught but a jar of unbaked clay and a thread
of untwisted cotton. In the innocence of her heart she stepped into the
lake, but the gods preserved her. After a time she wearied of this
sordid life, and one morning she arrayed herself in her queenly robes
and jewels, and going to the lake, as usual, stepped on the lotus
petals. When she plunged in her jar it melted away, and the untwisted
thread broke, and she herself sank beneath the water. But she was
saved, and thenceforward learned the evil of vanity and pride in
riches, and the strength of innocence and a pure mind. And the lotus
pool, in honour of the good queen Sundar&icirc;, was called by all men
the R&acirc;n&icirc; T&acirc;l, or &ldquo;the Queen&rsquo;s
Tank,&rdquo; and is to be seen to this day just outside the town of
K&acirc;bar, though the lotus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=

of Sh&acirc;hgarh has sunk into dust.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The same tale is told in Southern India of Renuk&acirc;, the mother
of Parasur&acirc;ma. In its Western form it is told in Switzerland of a
pious boy who served a monastery, and in his innocence was able to
carry water in a sieve without spilling a single drop.<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The number of lakes and tanks associated with some
legend, or endued with some special sanctity of their own, is legion.
Thus, the tank at Chakrat&icirc;ratha, near N&icirc;mkh&acirc;r, marks
the spot where the Chakra or discus of Vishnu fell during his contest
with Asuras.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1402src" href="#xd21e1402"
name="xd21e1402src">128</a> That near the Satopant glacier is said to
be fathomless, and no bird can fly over it. Bhotiyas presents offerings
to the lake, requesting the water spirit to keep the passes open and
aid them in their dangerous journeys. As they are denied entrance into
the temple of Badarin&acirc;th, it has for them all the virtue of
Badarin&acirc;th itself.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1408src" href=
"#xd21e1408" name="xd21e1408src">129</a> Another famous tank is that at
Amritsar, &ldquo;the Lake of Immortality.&rdquo; A holy woman once took
pity on a leper, and carried him to the banks of the tank. As he lay
there a crow swooped into the water and came out a dove as white as
snow. The leper saw the miracle, bathed, and was healed. The woman on
her return could not recognize her friend, and withdrew in horror from
his embraces. But the Guru R&acirc;m D&acirc;s came and explained
matters, and the grateful pair assisted him in embellishing the tank,
which has become the centre of the Sikh religion. The Tadag T&acirc;l
in the Hills is sacred to Bh&icirc;m Sen, and the curious fish which it
contains are said to be lice from the body of the hero. <span class=

<p>One day a Br&acirc;hman was passing the Mandkalla tank and saw a
marriage party sitting before the wedding feast; but they were all most
unaccountably silent and motionless. They asked him to join in the
meal, and he did so with some misgivings, which were soon justified
when he saw the heads of the whole party fall off before his eyes, and
they soon disappeared.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1414src" href=
"#xd21e1414" name="xd21e1414src">130</a> The R&acirc;ja R&acirc;ma
Chandra Sena was once hunting near the site of the present
Dhar&acirc;wat tank. He saw a crow drinking from a puddle, and, being
in want of water, he ordered the courtiers to have a tank dug, the
limits of which were to be the space that his horse would gallop round
when released. Fortunately for them they selected a site close to some
hills which checked the course of the horse. This reduced the tank to
comparatively moderate dimensions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1417src"
href="#xd21e1417" name="xd21e1417src">131</a></p>
<p>The tank at Lalitpur is famous for the cure of leprosy. One day, a
R&acirc;ja afflicted with the disease was passing by, and his
R&acirc;n&icirc; dreamt that he should eat some of the conferv&aelig;
on the surface. He ate it, and was cured; and next night the
R&acirc;n&icirc; dreamt that there was a vast treasure concealed there,

condition imposed on visitors to these holy tanks that they should
remove a certain quantity of earth and thus improve it.</p>
<p>Many tanks, again, are supposed to contain buried treasure which is
generally in charge of a Yaksha. Hence such places are regarded with
much awe. There is a tank of this kind in the Bijaygarh fort in the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;He who thinks of Him&acirc;chal (the
Him&acirc;laya), though he should not behold him, is greater than he
who performs all worship at K&acirc;si (Benares); as the dew is dried

Him&acirc;chal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1454src" href=
"#xd21e1454" name="xd21e1454src">138</a> Such was the devotion with
which the early Hindus looked on it as the home of the gods. Beyond it
their fancy created the elysium of Uttara Kuru, which may be most
properly regarded as an ideal picture created by the imagination of a
life of tranquil felicity, and not as a reminiscence of any actual
residence of the Kurus in the north.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>From early times the Him&acirc;layan valleys were the resort of the
sage and the ascetic. Almost every hill and river is consecrated by
their legends, and the whole country teems with memories of the early
religious life of the Hindu race. As in the mythology of many other
peoples,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1462src" href="#xd21e1462" name=
"xd21e1462src">140</a> it was regarded as the home of the sainted dead,

be the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

recesses, as at the Blockberg, where, as Aubrey tells us, &ldquo;the

Meru. The whole range is personified in Himavat, who is the father of
Gang&acirc; and Um&acirc; Dev&icirc;, who from her origin is known as

<h3 class="main">Mountain-worship among the Dr&acirc;vidians.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But, deeply rooted as the veneration for mountains is
in the minds of the early Aryans, there is reason to suspect that this
regard for mountains may be a survival from the beliefs of non-Aryan
races whom the Hindus supplanted or absorbed. At any rate, the belief
in the sanctity of mountains widely prevails among the non-Aryan or
Dr&acirc;vidian races. Most of these peoples worship mountains in
connection with the god of the rain. The Sant&acirc;ls sacrifice to
Marang Bura on a flat rock on the top of a mountain, and after
feasting, work themselves up into a state of frenzy to charm the rain.
The Korwas and K&ucirc;rs worship in the same way Mainp&acirc;t, a
plateau in the mountainous country south of the Son. The
N&acirc;gbansis and the Mund&acirc;ri Kols worship a huge rock as the
abode of the &ldquo;great god,&rdquo; Baradeo.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1475src" href="#xd21e1475" name="xd21e1475src">142</a> So, in
Garhw&acirc;l in the Chhipula pass is a shrine to the god of the
mountain. At Tolma is a temple to the Him&acirc;laya, and below
Dungagiri in the same valley is a shrine in honour of the same
peak.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1478src" href="#xd21e1478" name=
"xd21e1478src">143</a> In Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d in the Central Indian
plateau, S&ucirc;ryabh&acirc;n or &ldquo;Sun-rays&rdquo; is a very
common name for isolated round-peaked hills, on which the god is
supposed to dwell, and among the Kurkus, Dungardeo, the mountain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>god, resides on the nearest hill outside the
village. He is worshipped every year at the Dasahra festival with a
goat, two cocoa-nuts, five dates, with a ball of vermilion paste, and
is regarded by them as their special god.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1483src" href="#xd21e1483" name="xd21e1483src">144</a> The idea
that dwarfs, spirits, and fairies live on the tops of mountains is a
common belief in Europe.</p>
<p>As in the Him&acirc;laya, one of the main peaks, Nand&acirc;
Dev&icirc;, has been identified with P&acirc;rvat&icirc;, the mountain
goddess, so the aborigines of the Central Provinces have in
Kattarp&acirc;r, the Kattipen of the Kh&acirc;ndhs, a special deity of
ravines, as Rh&oelig;a Sybeli was to the Etruscans.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1488src" href="#xd21e1488" name="xd21e1488src">145</a> In the
Mirzapur hills the aboriginal tribes have an intense respect for
mountains. On the M&acirc;tra hill lives a Deo or demon known as
Darrap&acirc;t Deo. When R&acirc;vana abducted S&icirc;t&acirc; he is
said to have kept her on this hill for some time, and her palanquin,
turned into stone, is there to this day. No one ascends the mountain
through fear of the demon, except an Ojha or sorcerer, who sacrifices a
goat at the foot of the hill before he makes the attempt. So, in
Garhw&acirc;l the peak of Barmdeo is sacred to Dev&icirc;, and none can
intrude with impunity. A Faq&icirc;r who ventured to do so in the days
of yore was pitched across the river by the offended goddess.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1494src" href="#xd21e1494" name=
"xd21e1494src">146</a> On another Mirzapur hill, Chainpur, lives
Kot&icirc; R&acirc;n&icirc;, who is embodied in the locusts which
usually are found there. Similarly Pah&acirc;r Pando is a mountain
deity of the Dhark&acirc;rs, a sub-caste of the Doms. Bansapt&icirc;
M&acirc;&icirc;, who is half a forest and half a mountain goddess,
lives on Jhurma hill, and if any one dares to sing in her
neighbourhood, he becomes sick or mad. These mountain demons often take
the form of tigers and kill incautious intruders on their domains. On
the Aunri hill are two dreaded demons, Deor&acirc;san and Birwat, the
latter a B&icirc;r or malignant ghost of some one who died a violent
death. They rule the hail, and at harvest time the Baiga offers a goat,
and spreading rice on the ground, prays&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=

effectual.&rdquo; Mangesar, the rugged peak which frowns over the
valley of the Son, is a popular local god of the various Kolarian
races, and a shrine to B&acirc;ba or R&acirc;ja Mangesar, &ldquo;the
father and the king,&rdquo; is found in many of their villages.</p>

<h3 class="main">Respect Paid to the Vindhya and Kaim&ucirc;r
Ranges.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kaim&ucirc;r and Vindhyan ranges also enjoy a
certain amount of sanctity. On the latter the most famous shrines are
those of Asthbhuja or &ldquo;the eight-armed Dev&icirc;,&rdquo;
S&icirc;t&acirc;kunda or the pool of S&icirc;t&acirc;, and the temple
of Mah&acirc;r&acirc;n&icirc; Vindhyeswar&icirc;, the patron goddess of
the range, built where it trends towards the Gangetic valley. She has
travelled as far as Cutch, where she is worshipped under the corrupted
name of Vinj&acirc;n.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1508src" href=
"#xd21e1508" name="xd21e1508src">147</a> Her shrine has evil
associations with traditions of human sacrifice, derived from the
coarser aboriginal cultus which has now been adopted into
Br&acirc;hmanism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1511src" href="#xd21e1511"
name="xd21e1511src">148</a> There the Thags used to meet and share
their spoils with their patron goddess, and her Pandas or priests are
so disorderly that a special police guard has to be posted at the
shrine to ensure the peaceable division of the offerings among the
sharers, who mortgage and sell their right to participate in the
profits, like the advowson of a living in the English Church.</p>
<p>These two ranges, says the legend, are an offshoot from the
Him&acirc;laya. When R&acirc;ma was building the bridge across the
strait to Lanka, he sent his followers to Him&acirc;laya to collect
materials. They returned with a mighty burden, but meanwhile the hero
had completed his task; so he ordered them to throw down their loads,
and where the stones fell these ranges were produced. In the same way
the Maniparvata at Ajudhya is said to have been dropped by
Sugr&icirc;va, the monkey king of Kishkindhya, and the Irichh hills at
Jh&acirc;nsi are described to have been formed in the same way.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is another legend of the Vindhyas told in the story of Nala
and Damayant&icirc;. They were jealous of the Him&acirc;laya, the peaks
of which were each morning visited by the earliest rays of the rising
sun. The sun, on being appealed to, declared that it was impossible for
him to change his course. Immediately the Vindhyas swelled with rage,
and rising in the heavens, intercepted the view of the sun, moon, and
the constellations. The gods, alarmed, invoked the aid of the saint
Agastya. He went, accompanied by his wife, and requested the Vindhyas
to sink and let him pass to the south, and not rise till he returned.
They agreed, and gave passage to the saint, but as he never came back
they have never resumed their former height. Agastya finally settled on
the Malayam or Potiyam mountain, not far from Cape Comorin. He now
shines in the heavens as the regent of the star Canopus, and to him is
ascribed almost all the civilization of Southern India. The legend
possibly goes back to the arrival of the earliest Br&acirc;hmanic
missionaries in Southern India, and the name of the range, which
probably means &ldquo;the divider,&rdquo; marked the boundary between
the Aryan and Dr&acirc;vidian peoples. A similar story is told of one
of the ranges in Nep&acirc;l.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1519src" href=

<h3 class="main">Other Famous Hills.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A mention of some other famous hills in Northern India
may close this account of mountain-worship. At Gaya is the Dharma Sila,
or &ldquo;rock of piety,&rdquo; which was once the wife of the saint
Mar&icirc;chi. The lord of the infernal regions, by order of Brahma,
crushed it down on the head of the local demon.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1527src" href="#xd21e1527" name="xd21e1527src">150</a> The hills
of Goghar k&acirc; dh&acirc;r, in the Mundi State, have a reputation
similar to that of the Brocken in the Hartz mountains on Wulpurgis
night. On the 3rd of September the demons, witches, and magicians from
the most distant parts of India assemble here and hold their revels,
from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>which time it is dangerous for men to cross the
mountains. The spirits of the Kulu range are said to wage war with
those of the Goghar, and after a violent storm the peasants will show
the traveller the stones which have been hurled from range to range.
The last chief of Mundi was a mighty wizard himself. He had a little
book of spells which the demons were forced to obey, and when he placed
it in his mouth he was instantly transported where he pleased through
the air.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1532src" href="#xd21e1532" name=
"xd21e1532src">151</a></p>
<p>Another famous hill is that of Govardhan, near Mathura. This is the
hill which Krishna is fabled to have held aloft on the tip of his
finger for seven days, to protect the people of Braj from the tempests
poured down on them by Indra when he was deprived of his wonted
sacrifices. There is a local belief that as the waters of the
Jumn&acirc; are yearly decreasing in volume, so this hill is gradually
sinking. Not a particle of stone is allowed to be removed from it, and
even the road which crosses it at its lowest point, where only a few
fragments of the rock crop up overground, had to be carried over them
by a paved causeway.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1537src" href=

<p>The old weather god was Indra, who wars with Vritra or Ahi, the
dragon demon of drought, whom he compels to dispense the rain. He was
revered as the causer of fertility, and feared as the lord of the
lightning and the thunder. He has now been deposed from his
pre-eminence, and is little more than a <i>roi fain&eacute;ant</i>, who
lives in a luxurious heaven of his own, solaced by the dances of the
fairies who form his court, one of whom he occasionally bestows on some
favoured mortal who wins his kindness or forces him to obey his orders.
But his status is at present decidedly low, and it is remarkable in
what a contemptuous way even so orthodox a poet as Tulas&icirc;
D&acirc;s speaks of him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1558src" href=

suggests that this degradation of Indra may possibly be due to the fact
that he was a tribal god notoriously hostile to Br&acirc;hmans; and it
is certainly very suggestive from this point of view that he has come
to be regarded as the great deity of the Burman Buddhists. It is still
further remarkable that at Benares, the headquarters of
Br&acirc;hmanism, he has been replaced by a special rain god,
Dalbhyeswara, who perhaps takes his name from Dalbhya, an ancient
Rishi, who must be worshipped and kept properly dressed if the seasons
are not to become unfavourable.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1564src"

<p class="first">It is an idea common to the beliefs of many races,
that the spirits of the wind may be tied up in sacks and let out to

<p>Another side of the matter may be illustrated from Marco Polo.
&ldquo;During the three months of every year that the Lord (Kublai
Kh&acirc;n) resides at that place, if it should happen to be bad
weather, there are certain crafty enchanters and astrologers in his
train, who are such adepts in necromancy and the diabolical arts, that
they are able to prevent any cloud or storm passing over the spot on
which the Emperor&rsquo;s palace stands. Whatever they do in this way
is by the help of the Devil; but they make those people believe that it
is compassed by their own sanctity and the help of God. They always go
in a state of dirt and uncleanness, devoid of respect for themselves or
for those who see them, unkempt and sordidly attired.&rdquo;
Tim&ucirc;r in his &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; speaks of the Indian
J&acirc;ts using incantations to produce heavy rain, which hindered his
cavalry from acting against them. A Yadachi was captured, and when his
head had been taken off the storm ceased. B&acirc;bar speaks of one of
his early friends, Khw&acirc;jaka Mulai, who was acquainted with
Yadagar&icirc;, or the art of bringing on rain and snow by
incantations. In the same way in Nep&acirc;l the control of the weather
is supposed to be vested in the Lamas.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Rain-making and Nudity.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One very curious custom of rain-making has a series of
remarkable parallels in Europe. In Servia, in time of drought, a girl
is stripped and covered with flowers. She dances at each house, and the
mistress steps out and pours a jar of water over her, while her
companions sing rain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68"
name="pb68">68</a>]</span>songs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1602src"
href="#xd21e1602" name="xd21e1602src">161</a> In Russia the women draw
a furrow round the village, and bury at the juncture a cock, a cat, and
a dog. &ldquo;The dog is a demonic character in Russia, while the cat
is sacred. The offering of both seems to represent a desire to
conciliate both sides.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1605src" href=
"#xd21e1605" name="xd21e1605src">162</a> Mr. Conway thinks that the
nudity of the women represents their utter poverty and inability to
give more to conciliate the god of the rain; or that we have here a
form of the Godiva and Peeping Tom legend, &ldquo;where there is
probably a distant reflection of the punishment sometimes said to
overtake those who gazed too curiously upon the Swan Maiden with her
feathers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1608src" href="#xd21e1608"
name="xd21e1608src">163</a></p>
<p>The Godiva legend has been admirably illustrated by Mr.
Hartland,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1613src" href="#xd21e1613" name=
"xd21e1613src">164</a> who comes to the conclusion that it is the
survival of an annual rite in honour of a heathen goddess, and closely
connected with those nudity observances which we are discussing. The
difficulty is, however, to account for the nudity part of the ceremony.
It may possibly be based on the theory that spirits dread indecency, or
rather the male and female principles.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1616src" href="#xd21e1616" name="xd21e1616src">165</a></p>
<p>This may be the origin of the indecencies of word and act practised
at the Hol&icirc; and Kajar&icirc; festivals in Upper India, which are
both closely connected with the control of the weather. Among the
Ramoshis of the Dakkhin the bridegroom is stripped naked before the
anointing ceremony commences, and the same custom prevails very
generally in Upper India. The Mh&acirc;rs of Sholapur are buried naked,
even the loin-cloth being taken off. Barren women worship a naked
female figure at Bijapur. At Dayamava&rsquo;s festival in the
Karn&acirc;tak, women walk naked to the temple where they make their
vows; and the M&acirc;ng, who carries the scraps of holy meat which he
scatters in the fields to promote fertility, is also naked.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1621src" href="#xd21e1621" name=
"xd21e1621src">166</a> The same idea of scaring evil <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>spirits
from temples possibly accounts for much of the obscene sculpture to be
found on the walls of many Hindu shrines, and it may be noted in
illustration of the same principle that in Nep&acirc;l temples are
decorated with groups of obscene figures as a protection against
lightning.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1626src" href="#xd21e1626" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Rites Special to Women.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Connected with the same principle it may be noted that
in India, as in many other places, there are rites of the nature of the
Bona Dea, in which only women take part, and from which males are
excluded. In some of these rites nudity forms a part. Thus, in Italy,
La Bella Marte is invoked when three girls, always stark naked, consult
the cards to know whether a lover is true or which of them is likely to
be married.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1634src" href="#xd21e1634" name=
"xd21e1634src">168</a> A number of similar usages have been discussed
by Mr. Hartland. We have already noticed the custom of sun
impregnation. Among Hindus, a woman who is barren and desires a child
stands naked facing the sun and desires his aid to remove her
barrenness. In one of the folk-tales the witch stands naked while she
performs her spells.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1637src" href=
"#xd21e1637" name="xd21e1637src">169</a></p>
<p>The rain custom in India is precisely the same as has been already
illustrated by examples from Europe. During the Gorakhpur Famine in
1873&ndash;74, there were many accounts received of women going about
with a plough by night, stripping themselves naked and dragging the
plough over the fields as an invocation of the rain god. The men kept
carefully out of the way while this was being done, and it was supposed
that if the women were seen by the men the rite would lose its effect.
Mr. Frazer on this remarks that &ldquo;it is not said they plunge the
plough into a stream or sprinkle it with water. But the charm would
hardly be complete without it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1642src" href="#xd21e1642" name="xd21e1642src">170</a> It was on
my authority that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70"
name="pb70">70</a>]</span>custom which Messrs. Frazer and Hartland
quote was originally recorded, and I do not remember at the time
hearing of this part of the ritual. Later inquiries do not point to it
as part of the rite in Upper India.</p>
<p>It may be well to adduce other instances of this nudity rite. In
Sirsa, when a horse falls sick, the cure is to kill a fowl or a he-goat
and let its warm blood flow into the mouth of the animal; but if this
cannot be done quickly, it is sufficient for a man to take off all his
clothes and strike the horse seven times on the forehead with his
shoe.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1649src" href="#xd21e1649" name=
"xd21e1649src">171</a> Here the nudity and the blows with the shoe are
means to drive off the demon of disease. In Chhattarpur, when rain
falls a woman and her husband&rsquo;s sister take off all their clothes
and drop seven cakes of cow-dung into a mud reservoir for storing
grain. If a man and his maternal uncle perform the same ceremony, it is
equally effective; but as a rule women do it, and the special days for
the rite are Sunday and Wednesday. Here we have the custom in process
of modification, males, one of whom is a relation in the female line,
being substituted for the female officiants.</p>
<p>Another similar means of expelling the demon of disease is given by
Mrs. Fanny Parkes in her curious book entitled &ldquo;Wanderings of a
Pilgrim in search of the Picturesque.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1654src" href="#xd21e1654" name="xd21e1654src">172</a> &ldquo;The
Hindu women in a most curious way propitiate the goddess who brings
cholera into the b&acirc;z&acirc;r. They go out in the evening, about 7
p.m., sometimes two or three hundred at a time, each carrying a
<i>lota</i> or brass vessel filled with sugar, water, cloves, etc. In
the first place they make <i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i>; then, stripping off
their sheets and binding their sole petticoat round their waists, as
high above the knee as it can be pulled up, they perform a most frantic
sort of dance, forming themselves into a circle, while in the centre of
the circle about five or six women dance entirely naked, beating their
hands together over their heads, and then applying them behind with a
great smack that keeps time with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>music, and with the song
they scream out all the time, accompanied by native instruments played
by men who stand at a distance, to the sound of which these women dance
and sing, looking like frantic creatures. The men avoid the place where
the ceremony takes place, but here and there one or two men may be seen
looking on, whose presence does not seem to molest the nut-brown
dancers in the least; they shriek and sing and dance and scream most
marvellously.&rdquo; Here we find the rule of privacy at these nudity
rites slightly modified.</p>
<p>Another instance of the nudity rite in connection with cattle
disease comes from J&acirc;landhar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1667src"
href="#xd21e1667" name="xd21e1667src">173</a> &ldquo;When an animal is
sick the remedy is for some one to strip himself and to walk round the
patient with some burning straw or cane fibre in his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nudity also appears to be in some places a condition of the erection
of a pinnacle on a Hindu temple. &ldquo;The Temple of Arang in
R&acirc;&ecirc;pur district and that at Deobalada were built at the
same time. When they were finished and the pinnacles (<i>kalas</i>) had
to be put on, the mason and his sister agreed to put them on
simultaneously at an auspicious moment. The day and hour being fixed by
Br&acirc;hmans, the two, stripping themselves naked, <i>according to
custom on such occasions</i>, climbed up to the top. As they got up to
the top each could see the other, and each through shame jumped down
into the tank close to their respective temples, where they still stand
turned into stone, and are visible when the tank water falls low in
seasons of drought.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1678src" href=
"#xd21e1678" name="xd21e1678src">174</a></p>
<p>Of the regular nudity rite in case of failure of rain, we have a
recent instance from Chun&acirc;r in the Mirzapur district. &ldquo;The
rains this year held off for a long time, and last night (24th July,
1892) the following ceremony was performed secretly. Between the hours
of 9 and 10 p.m. a barber&rsquo;s wife went from door to door and
invited all the women to join in ploughing. They all collected in a
field from which all males were excluded. Three women from a
cultivator&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72"
name="pb72">72</a>]</span>family stripped off all their clothes; two
were yoked to a plough like oxen, and a third held the handle. They
then began to imitate the operation of ploughing. The woman who had the
plough in her hand shouted, &lsquo;O Mother Earth! bring parched grain,
water and chaff. Our bellies are bursting to pieces from hunger and
thirst.&rsquo; Then the landlord and village accountant approached them
and laid down some grain, water and chaff in the field. The women then
dressed and went home. By the grace of God the weather changed almost
immediately, and we had a good shower.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1685src" href="#xd21e1685" name="xd21e1685src">175</a> Here we
see the ceremony elaborately organized; the privacy taboo is enforced,
and the ritual is in the nature of sympathetic magic, intended to
propitiate Mother Earth.</p>
<p>The nudity rite for the expulsion of disease is also found in
Madras. &ldquo;The image of Mariyamma, cut out of Margosa wood, is
carried from her temple to a stone called a <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1690" title="Source: Buddukal">Baddukal</span>, in the centre of
the village, on the afternoon of the first day of the feast. A rounded
stone, about six inches above the ground and about eight inches across,
is to be seen just inside the gate of every village. It is what is
called the Baddukal or navel stone; it is worshipped in times of
calamity, especially during periods of cattle disease; often women
passing it with water pour a little on it, and every one on first going
out of the village in the morning is supposed to give it some little
tribute of attention. The following day all men and women of
S&ucirc;dra castes substitute garments of leaves of the Margosa, little
branches tied together, for their ordinary clothes, and thus attired go
with music to the goddess.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1693src"
href="#xd21e1693" name="xd21e1693src">176</a> Here the dress may imply
some form of nudity rite, or may be a reminiscence of the time when,
like the Ju&acirc;ngs of Chota N&acirc;gpur, they wore leaf aprons.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that rites of this kind largely prevail in
India, but, as might naturally be expected, they are very carefully
concealed, and it is extremely difficult to obtain precise information
about them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=

<h3 class="main">Other Rites to bring Rain.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Besides these nudity rites there are many ways of
causing rain to fall. In Kumaun when rain fails they sink a
Br&acirc;hman up to his lips in a tank, and there he goes on repeating
the name of R&acirc;ja Indra, the god of rain, for a day or two, when
rain is sure to fall; or they dig a trench five or six feet deep and
make a Br&acirc;hman or a Jogi sit in it, when the god, in pity for the
holy man, will relent and give rain. Another plan is to hang a frog
with his mouth open on a bamboo, and the deity pities him and brings
the rain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1705src" href="#xd21e1705" name=
"xd21e1705src">177</a> In Mirzapur they turn a plough upside down and
bury it in a field, rub the lingam of Mah&acirc;deva with cow-dung, and
offer water at the grave of a Brahm or bachelor Br&acirc;hman.</p>
<p>Among the Bh&icirc;ls in time of drought women and girls go out
dancing and singing with bows and arrows in their hands, and seizing a
buffalo belonging to another village, sacrifice it to the goddess
K&acirc;l&icirc;. The headman of the village to which the animal
belongs seldom objects to the appropriation of it. If he does, the
women by abusing and threatening to shoot him always have their own
way.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1710src" href="#xd21e1710" name=
"xd21e1710src">178</a> Analogous to this regular rain sacrifice is the
custom at Ahmadnagar, where on the bright 3rd of Bais&acirc;kh
(April&ndash;May) the boys of two neighbouring villages fight with
slings and stones. The local belief is that if the fight be
discontinued, rain fails, or if rain does fall that it produces a
plague of rats.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1713src" href="#xd21e1713"
name="xd21e1713src">179</a> At Ahmad&acirc;b&acirc;d, again, there is a
city headman, known as the Nagar Seth or &ldquo;chief man of the
town.&rdquo; When rain holds off he has to perambulate the city walls,
pouring out milk to appease R&acirc;ja Indra.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1716src" href="#xd21e1716" name="xd21e1716src">180</a> Here we
reach the &ldquo;sympathetic magic&rdquo; type of observance under
which most of the other practices may be classed, though here and there
we seem to find the germ of the principle of vicarious sacrifice. Thus
in the Panj&acirc;b the village girls pour down on an old woman as she
passes some cow-dung dissolved in water; or an old woman is made to sit
down under the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>house-roof spout and get a wetting when it rains.
Here the idea must be that her sufferings in some way propitiate the
angry god. In the Muzaffarnagar District, if rain fails, they worship
R&acirc;ja Indra and read the story of the Megha R&acirc;ja, or king of
the rain. In his name they give alms to the poor and release a young
bull or buffalo. Crushed grain is cooked on the edge of a tank in his
honour and in the name of the rain god Khw&acirc;ja Khizr, and some
offering is made to Bh&ucirc;miya, the lord of the soil. In
Chhattarpur, on a wall facing the east, they paint two figures with
cow-dung&mdash;one representing Indra and the other Megha R&acirc;ja,
with their legs up and their heads hanging down. It is supposed that
the discomfort thus caused to them will compel them to grant the boon
of rain. The Mirzapur Korwas, when rain fails, get the Baiga to make a
sacrifice and prayer to S&ucirc;raj Deota, the Sun godling.</p>
<p>Another common plan in Upper India is for a gang of women to come
out to where a man is ploughing and drive him and his oxen by force
back to the village, where he and his cattle are well fed. Another
device is to seize the blacksmith&rsquo;s anvil and pitch it into a
well or the village tank. We have already given instances of the
connection of wells with rainfall, such as the case of the well in
Fargh&acirc;na which caused rain if defiled.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1723src" href="#xd21e1723" name="xd21e1723src">181</a> Mr. Gomme
has collected several European instances of the same belief.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1726src" href="#xd21e1726" name=
"xd21e1726src">182</a> The anvil is probably used for this purpose
because it is regarded as a sort of fetish, and the blacksmith himself
is, as we shall see later on, considered as invested with supernatural
powers.</p>
<p>In the Panj&acirc;b, apparently on the principle of vicarious
sacrifice to which reference has been already made, an earthen pot of
filth is carried to the door of some old woman cursed with a bad
temper, and thrown down at her threshold, which is a sacred place. If
she then falls into a rage and gives vent to her feelings in abusive
language, the rain will come down. The old woman is considered a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>sort of witch, and if she is punished the
influence which restrains the rain will be removed.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1733src" href="#xd21e1733" name="xd21e1733src">183</a></p>
<p>There are numerous instances in which the king is held responsible
for a failure of the rain. In K&acirc;ngra there are some local gods
whose temples are endowed with rent-free lands. When rain is wanted,
these deities are ordered to provide it; and if they fail, they have to
pay a fine into the R&acirc;ja&rsquo;s treasury. This is the way the
Chinese treat their gods who refuse to do their duty.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1738src" href="#xd21e1738" name="xd21e1738src">184</a></p>
<p>The song of Alha and Udal, which describes the struggle between the
Hindus and the early Muhammadan invaders, is sung in Oudh to procure
rain. In the Hills smart showers are attributed to the number of
marriages going on at the time in the plains. The bride and bridegroom,
as we shall see in the legend of Dulha Deo, are particularly exposed to
the demoniacal influence of the weather. In the Eastern Districts of
the North-Western Provinces the people will not kill wolves, as they
say that wherever there falls a drop of a wolf&rsquo;s blood the rain
will be deficient.</p>
<p>To close this catalogue of devices to procure rain, we may note that
it is a common belief that sacred stones are connected with rainfall.
In the temple of Mars at Rome there was a great stone cylinder which,
when there was a drought, was rolled by the priests through the
town.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1745src" href="#xd21e1745" name=
"xd21e1745src">185</a> In Mingrelia, to get rain they dip a holy image
in water daily till it rains. In Navarre the image of St. Peter was
taken to a river, where some prayed to him for rain, but others called
out to duck him in the water.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1748src" href=
"#xd21e1748" name="xd21e1748src">186</a> A stone in the form of a cross
at Iona was used for the same purpose.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1751src" href="#xd21e1751" name="xd21e1751src">187</a> So in
India the relics of Gautama Buddha were believed to have the same
influence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1754src" href="#xd21e1754" name=
"xd21e1754src">188</a> In Beh&acirc;r in seasons of drought a holy
stone, known as N&acirc;r&acirc;yana Chakra, is kept in a vessel of
water; sometimes a piece of plantain leaf on which are written the
names of one hundred and eight villages beginning with the letter
<i>K</i> and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=

water.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1763src" href="#xd21e1763" name=
"xd21e1763src">189</a> In the same way the lingam of Mah&acirc;deva, a
thirsty deity, who needs continual cooling to relieve his distress,
must be kept continually moist to avoid drought. Not long ago when rain
failed at Mirzapur, the people contributed to maintain a gang of
labourers who brought water to pour on a famous lingam. The same custom
prevails in Samoa.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1766src" href=
"#xd21e1766" name="xd21e1766src">190</a> There, when rain was
excessive, the stone representing the rain-making god was laid by the
fire and kept warm till fine weather set in; but in time of drought the
priest and his followers, dressed up in fine mats, went in procession
to the stream, dipped the stone, and prayed for a shower.</p>

<h3 class="main">Devices to Cause Rain to Cease.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In England when rain is in excess the little children
sing, &ldquo;Rain! Rain! Go away! Come again on a Saturday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In India there are many devices intended to secure the same object.
One is the reverse of the nudity charm which we have already discussed.
In Madras, a woman, generally an ugly widow, is made to dance,
sometimes naked, with a burning stick in her hand and facing the sky.
This is supposed to disgust Varuna, the sky god, who shrinks away from
such a sight and withholds the rain.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1776src" href="#xd21e1776" name="xd21e1776src">191</a> Other
devices have the same object, to put pressure on the deities who are
responsible for the excessive rain. Thus, in Muzaffarnagar the Muni or
Rishi Agastya, who is a great personage in early folk-lore, is supposed
to have power to stop the rain. When rain is in excess they draw a
figure of him on a loin cloth and put it out in the rain. Some paint
his figure on the outside of the house and let the rain wash it away.
This generally brings him to his senses and he gives relief. Another
practice, which is believed to be employed by evil-minded people who
are selfishly interested in a drought, is to light a lamp with melted
butter and put it outside when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77"
href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>the rain-clouds collect. The
rain god is afraid to put out the sacred light, and retires. Another
way in use in the Panj&acirc;b is to give an unmarried girl some oil
and get her to pour it on the ground, saying, &ldquo;If I pour not out
the oil, mine the sin; if thou disperse not the clouds, thine the
sin.&rdquo; In Mirzapur it is considered a good plan to name twenty-one
men who are blind of an eye, and consequently ill-omened, and make
twenty-one knots in a cord and tie it under the eaves of the house. In
Kumaun many devices are used to effect the same result. Some hot oil is
poured into the left ear of a dog. When the pain makes him yell it is
believed that R&acirc;ja Indra takes pity on him and stops the rain.
Another plan is very like the Mirzapur device. Five, seven, or eleven
grains of Urad pulse are placed in a piece of cloth, wrapped up and
tied with a treble cord. Each grain bears the name of a blind person,
known to the man who is carrying out the rite. This is known as the
&ldquo;binding of the blind men.&rdquo; The packet is either buried
under the eaves of a house where the water drips, or put in a tree. The
object is to excite the compassion of R&acirc;ja Indra by their
sufferings. Others take seven pieces of granite, seven grains of
mustard, and seven bits of goat-dung, parch them in an oven, and then
put them under the drip of the eaves. These represent the demons, who
are enemies of Indra, and he is so pleased at their discomfiture that
he disperses the clouds. Others fix up a harrow perpendicularly where
four roads meet. As this instrument is always used in a horizontal
position, this indicates that gross injustice is being done to the
world, and the rain god relents. Others when the thunder roars in the
rain-clouds invoke the saint Agastya, who once drank up all the waters
of the world in four sips; so all the clouds fear him and disperse when
he is invoked.</p>
<p>Another favourite plan is to fee a Br&acirc;hman to make sixty holes
in a piece of wood and run a string through all of them. While he is
thus &ldquo;binding up the rain&rdquo; he recites spells in honour of
the Sun godling, S&ucirc;raj N&acirc;r&acirc;yan, who is moved to
interfere. Others take a piece of unleavened bread, go into the fields
and place it on the ground; or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78"
href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>taking some sugar, rice, and
other articles ordinarily used in worship to a place where four roads
meet, defile them in a particularly disgusting way. On such substances
the rain is ashamed to fall. In Bombay a leaf-plate filled with cooked
rice and curds is placed in some open spot where the rain can see it
and avoid it. If the rain should persist in coming, a live coal is laid
on a tile and placed in some open place, where it is implored to
swallow the hateful rain. All these practices are magic of the ordinary
sympathetic kind.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1785src" href="#xd21e1785"
name="xd21e1785src">192</a></p>
<p>Rain-clouds are supposed also to be under the influence of the Evil
Eye, and will blow over without giving rain if the malicious glance
falls upon them. Hence, when rain is needed, if any one runs out of a
house bareheaded while it is raining, he is ordered in at once, or he
is told to put on his cap or turban, for a bareheaded man is apt to
wish involuntarily that the rain may cease, and thus injure his
neighbours.</p>
<p>Everywhere it is believed that the Banya or cornchandler, who is
interested in high prices, buries some water in an earthen pot in order
to stop the rain.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Hail and Whirlwind.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The hail and the whirlwind are, like most of the
natural phenomena which we have been discussing, attributed to
demoniacal agency. The Maruts who ride on the whirlwind and direct the
storm hold a prominent place in the Veda, where they are represented as
the friends and allies of Indra. Another famous tempest demon was
Trin&acirc;vartta, who assumed the form of a whirlwind and carried off
the infant Krishna, but was killed by the child.</p>
<p>Mr. Leland<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1799src" href="#xd21e1799"
name="xd21e1799src">193</a> tells a curious Italian story of a peasant
who killed the church sexton with his billhook because he stopped
ringing the bell and thus allowed the hail to injure his vines. This
illustrates a well-known principle that demons, and in particular the
demon who brings the hail, can be scared by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>noise.
Thus Aubrey tells us:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1804src" href=
"#xd21e1804" name="xd21e1804src">194</a>&mdash;&ldquo;At Paris, when it
begins to thunder and lighten, they do presently ring out the great
bell at the Abbey of St. Germain, which they do believe makes it cease.
When it thundered and lightened they did ring St. Adelm&rsquo;s bell in
Malmesbury Abbey. The curious do say that the ringing of bells
exceedingly disturbs spirits.&rdquo; Hence one plan of driving away the
hail is to take out an iron griddle-plate and beat it with a bamboo.
Here the use of iron, a well-known demon scarer, increases the efficacy
of the rite. It is also an improvement if this be done by a virgin, and
in some places it is considered sufficient if when the hail falls an
unmarried girl is sent out with an iron plate in her hand. Possibly
following out the same train of ideas, the Kharw&acirc;rs of Mirzapur,
when hail falls, throw into the courtyard the wooden peg of the
corn-mill, which, as we shall see, is considered possessed of certain
magical powers.</p>
<p>In Muzaffarnagar, when hail begins they pray at once to two noted
demons, Ism&acirc;&icirc;l Jogi and Non&acirc; Cham&acirc;rin, and ring
a bell in a Saiva temple to scare the demon.</p>
<p>Another method is to put pressure on the hail demon by the pretence
of sheer physical pain. Thus in Mult&acirc;n it is believed that if you
can catch a hailstone in the air before it reaches the ground and cut
it in two with a pair of scissors the hail will abate.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1811src" href="#xd21e1811" name=
"xd21e1811src">195</a> Not long ago a lady at Nam&icirc; T&acirc;l,
when a hailstorm came on, saw her gardener rush into the kitchen and
bring out the cook&rsquo;s chopper, with which he began to make strokes
on the ground where the hail was falling. It appeared on inquiry that
he believed that the hail would dread being cut and cease to
fall.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1814src" href="#xd21e1814" name=
"xd21e1814src">196</a> In Kumaun, where hail is much dreaded, there are
many devices of the same kind. Some put an axe in the open air with the
edge turned up, so that the hailstones may be cut in pieces and cease
falling. Another plan is to spit at the hail as it falls, or to
sprinkle the hailstones with blood drawn from some famous magician, a
rite which can hardly be anything but a survival of human sacrifice. A
third device is to call an enchanter and make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>him blow
a conch-shell in the direction of the hail. Others put a churn in the
open air when the rain is falling, in the belief that when the
hailstones touch it they will become as soft as butter. Others, again,
when hail falls, send out a wizard or one possessed by some deity and
make him beat the hailstones with a shoe.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1819src" href="#xd21e1819" name="xd21e1819src">197</a></p>
<p>There are, again, certain persons specially in charge of the hail.
Thus, &ldquo;at the town of Cleon&aelig; in Argolis there were watchmen
maintained at the public expense to look out for hailstorms. When they
saw a hail-cloud approaching they made a signal, whereupon the farmers
turned out and sacrificed lambs and fowls. They believed that when the
clouds had tasted the blood they would turn aside and go somewhere
else. If any man was too poor to afford a lamb or a fowl, he pricked
his finger with a sharp instrument and offered his own blood to the
clouds; and the hail, we are told, turned aside from his fields as
readily as from those where it had been propitiated with the blood of
victims.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1824src" href="#xd21e1824"
name="xd21e1824src">198</a> In the same way the duty of charming away
the hail is, in Kumaun, entrusted to a certain class of Br&acirc;hmans
known as Woli or Oliya (<i>ola</i>, &ldquo;hail&rdquo;). Their method
is to take a dry gourd, which they fill with pebbles, grains of Urad
pulse, mustard, goat-dung and seeds of cotton. This is then tied by a
triple cord to the highest tree on a mountain overhanging the village.
Until the crops are cut the Oliya goes to this place every day and
mutters his incantations. If the crops are reaped without disaster of
any kind he is liberally remunerated.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1830src" href="#xd21e1830" name="xd21e1830src">199</a></p>
<p>As has been already said, whirlwinds are the work of demons. The
witches in Macbeth meet in thunder, lightning and rain, they can loose
and bind the winds and cause vessels to be tempest-tossed at sea. The
same principle was laid down by Pythagoras;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1835src" href="#xd21e1835" name="xd21e1835src">200</a> and
Herodotus<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1838src" href="#xd21e1838" name=
"xd21e1838src">201</a> describes the people of Psylli marching in a
body to fight the south wind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=
"#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>which had dried up their water-tanks.
In Ireland it is believed that a whirlwind denotes that a devil is
dancing with a witch; or that the fairies are rushing by, intent on
carrying off some victim to fairyland. The only help is to fling clay
at the passing wind, and the fairies will be compelled to drop the
mortal child or the beautiful young girl they have abducted.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1843src" href="#xd21e1843" name=
"xd21e1843src">202</a> A gentleman at Listowel not long ago was much
astonished when a cloud of dust was being blown along a road to see an
old woman rush to the side and drag handfuls of grass out of the fence,
which she threw in great haste into the cloud of dust. He inquired and
learned that this was in order to give <i>something</i> to the fairies
which were flying along in the dust. So in Italy, Spolviero is the wind
spirit which flies along in the dust eddies.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1850src" href="#xd21e1850" name="xd21e1850src">203</a></p>
<p>In the Panj&acirc;b Pheru<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1855src" href=
"#xd21e1855" name="xd21e1855src">204</a> is the deity of the petty
whirlwinds which blow when the little dust-clouds rise in the hot
weather. He was a Br&acirc;hman, and a long story is told of him, how
he worshipped Sakhi Sarwar, was made Governor of
Im&acirc;n&acirc;b&acirc;d by Akbar, but he abandoned the saint and
returned to his caste, whereupon he was afflicted with leprosy. When he
repented he was cured by eating some magical earth and believed in the
saint till he died. His shrine is at Miy&acirc;nk&ecirc;, in the Lahore
District, and when a Panj&acirc;bi sees a whirlwind he calls out,
<i>Bh&acirc;i Pheru, teri k&acirc;r</i>&mdash;&ldquo;May Bh&acirc;i
Pheru protect us!&rdquo; Another whirlwind demon, the saint Rahma, was
once neglected at the wheat harvest, and he raised a whirlwind which
blew for nine days in succession, and wrought such damage in the
threshing-floors that since then his shrine receives the appropriate
offerings. On the same principle whirlwinds are called in Bombay
Bag&acirc;lya or devils.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1861src" href=
"#xd21e1861" name="xd21e1861src">205</a></p>
<p>Among the Mirzapur Korwas, when a dust-storm comes, the women thrust
the house broom, which, as we shall see, is a demon scarer, into the
thatch, so that it may not be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href=
"#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>blown away. The Pankas in the same
way make their women hold the thatch and throw the rice mortar and the
flour-mill pivot into the courtyard. The wind is ashamed of being
defeated by the power of women and ceases to blow.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All over the world people say that if when a meteor or
falling star darts across the sky they can utter a wish before it
disappears, that wish will be granted. The old Norsemen believed that
it implied that a dragon was flashing through the air. In
Italy<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1873src" href="#xd21e1873" name=
"xd21e1873src">206</a> the sight of such a body is a cure for blear
eyes. In India it is believed that the residence of a soul in heaven is
proportionate to the charities done by him on earth, and when his
allotted period is over he falls as an aerolite. A falling star means
that the soul of some great man is passing through the air, and when
people see one of these stars they thrust their five fingers into their
mouths to prevent their own souls from joining his company. Many of
these aerolites are worshipped as lingams in Saiva shrines. One which
fell at S&icirc;t&acirc;marhi in Bengal in 1880, has now been deified,

<h3 class="main">The Heroic Godlings.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next to these deities which have been classed as the
godlings of nature, come those which have a special local worship of
their own. The number of these godlings is immense, and their functions
and attributes so varied, that it is extremely difficult to classify
them on any intelligible principle. Some of them are pure village
godlings, of whom the last Census has unearthed an enormous number all
through Northern India. Some of them, like Hanum&acirc;n or
Bh&icirc;msen, are survivals in a somewhat debased form of the
second-rate deities or heroes of the older mythology. Some have risen
to the rank, or are gradually being elevated to the status, of national
deities. Some are in all probability the local gods of the degraded
races, whom we may tentatively assume to be autochthonous. Many of
these have almost certainly been absorbed into Br&acirc;hmanism at a
comparatively recent period. Some are in process of elevation to the
orthodox pantheon. But it will require a much more detailed analysis of
the national faith than the existing materials permit, before it will
be possible to make a final classification of this mob of deities on
anything approaching a definite principle.</p>
<p>The deities of the heroic class are as a rule benignant, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>are generally worshipped by most Hindus. Those
that have been definitely promoted into the respectable divine cabinet,
like Hanum&acirc;n, have Br&acirc;hmans or members of the ascetic
orders as their priests, and their images, if not exactly admitted into
the holy of holies of the greater shrines, are still allotted a
respectable position in the neighbourhood, and receive a share in the
offerings of the faithful.</p>
<p>The local position of the shrine very often defines the status of
the deity. To many godlings of this class is allotted the duty of
acting as warders (dw&acirc;rap&acirc;la) to the temples of the great
gods. Thus, at the Ashthbhuja hill in Mirzapur, the pilgrim to the
shrine of the eight-armed Dev&icirc; meets first on the road an image
of the monkey god Hanum&acirc;n, before he comes into the immediate
presence of the goddess. So at Benares, Bhaironn&acirc;th is chief
police officer (Kotw&acirc;l) or guardian of all the Saiva temples.
Similarly at Jageswar beyond Almora we find Kshetrap&acirc;l, at
Badarin&acirc;th Ghantakaran, at Ked&acirc;rn&acirc;th Bhairava, and at
Tungn&acirc;th K&acirc;l Bhairon.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1912src"
href="#xd21e1912" name="xd21e1912src">1</a> In many places, as the
pilgrim ascends to the greater temples, he comes to a place where the
first view of the shrine is obtained. This is known as the
Devadekhn&icirc; or spot from which the deity is viewed. This is
generally occupied by some lower-class deity, who is just beginning to
be considered respectable. Then comes the temple dedicated to the
warden, and lastly the real shrine itself. There can be little doubt
that this represents the process by which gods which are now admittedly
within the inner circle of the first class, such as the beast
incarnations of Vishnu, the elephant-headed Ganesa, and the
S&acirc;ktis or impersonations of the female energies of nature,
underwent a gradual elevation.</p>

"HANUM&Acirc;N AS A WARDEN." width="423" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">HANUM&Acirc;N AS A WARDEN.</p>
</div>
<p>This process is actually still going on before our eyes. Thus, the
familiar Gor B&acirc;ba, a deified ghost of the aboriginal races, has
in many places become a new manifestation of Siva, as Goreswara.
Similarly, the powerful and malignant goddesses, who were by ruder
tribes propitiated with the sacrifice of a buffalo or a goat, have been
annexed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>Br&acirc;hmanism as two of the numerous forms of
Durg&acirc; Dev&icirc;, by the transparent fiction of a
Bhains&acirc;sur&icirc; or K&acirc;l&icirc; Dev&icirc;. In the case of
the former her origin is clearly proved by the fact that she is
regarded as a sort of tribal deity of the mixed tribe of
K&acirc;nhpuriya R&acirc;jputs in Oudh. Similarly
Mah&acirc;m&acirc;&icirc;, or the &ldquo;Great Mother,&rdquo; a
distinctively aboriginal goddess whose shrine consists of a low flat
mound of earth with seven knobs of coloured clay at the head or west
side, has been promoted into the higher pantheon as Jagadamb&acirc;
Dev&icirc;, or &ldquo;Mother of the World.&rdquo; Her shrine is still a
simple flat mound of earth with seven knobs at the top, and a flag in
front to the east.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1924src" href=
"#xd21e1924" name="xd21e1924src">2</a> More extended analysis will
probably show that the obligations of Br&acirc;hmanism to the local
cultus are much greater than is commonly supposed.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Hanum&acirc;n.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">First among the heroic godlings is Hanum&acirc;n,
&ldquo;He of the large jaws,&rdquo; or, as he is generally called,
Mah&acirc;b&icirc;r, the &ldquo;great hero,&rdquo; the celebrated
monkey chief of the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana, who assisted R&acirc;ma in
his campaign against the giant R&acirc;vana to recover
S&icirc;t&acirc;. Hardly any event in his mythology, thanks to the
genius of Tulas&icirc; D&acirc;s, the great Hindi poet of
Hindust&acirc;n, is more familiar to the Hindu peasant than this. It
forms the favourite subject of dramatic representation at the annual
festival of the Dasahra. There Hanum&acirc;n, in fitting attire,
marches along the stage at the head of his army of bears and monkeys,
and the play ends with the destruction of R&acirc;vana, whose great
body, formed of wickerwork and paper, is blown up with fireworks, amid
the delighted enthusiasm of the excited audience.</p>
<p>It is almost certain that the worship of Hanum&acirc;n does not come
down from the earliest ages of the Hindu faith, though it has been
suggested that he is the legitimate descendant of Vrisha-kapi, the
great monkey of the Veda.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1934src" href=
"#xd21e1934" name="xd21e1934src">3</a> Besides being a great warrior he
was noted for his skill in magic, grammar and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>the art
of healing. Many local legends connect him with sites in Northern
India. Hills, like the Vindhya and that at Govardhan, are, as we have
seen, attributed to him or to his companions. The more extreme school
of modern comparative mythologists would make out that Hanum&acirc;n is
only the impersonation of the great cloud-monkey which fights the
sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1939src" href="#xd21e1939" name=
"xd21e1939src">4</a></p>
<p>But the fact of monkey-worship is susceptible of a much simpler
explanation. The ape, from his appearance and human ways, is closely
associated with man. It is a belief common to all folk-lore that
monkeys were once human beings who have suffered degradation,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1944src" href="#xd21e1944" name="xd21e1944src">5</a>
and according to one common belief stealers of fruit become monkeys in
their next incarnation. But the common theory that the monkey is
venerated in memory of the demigod Hanum&acirc;n is, as Sir A.
Lyall<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1947src" href="#xd21e1947" name=
"xd21e1947src">6</a> remarks, &ldquo;plainly putting the cart before
the horse, for the monkey is evidently at the bottom of the whole
story. Hanum&acirc;n is now generally supposed to have been adopted
into the Hindu heaven from the non-Aryan or aboriginal idolaters;
though, to my mind, any uncivilized Indian would surely fall down and
worship at first sight of an ape. Then there is the modern idea that
the god was really a great chief of some such aboriginal tribe as those
which to this day dwell almost like wild creatures in the remote
forests of India; and this may be the nucleus of fact in the legend
regarding him. It seems as if hero-worship and animal-worship had got
mixed up in the legend of Hanum&acirc;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, it must be remembered that the so-called Aryans
enjoy no monopoly of his worship. He is sometimes like a tribal godling
of the aboriginal Suiris, and the wild Bhuiyas of Keunjhar identify him
with Bor&acirc;m, the Sun godling.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1952src"
href="#xd21e1952" name="xd21e1952src">7</a> It is at least a possible
supposition that his worship may have been imported into
Br&acirc;hmanism from some such source as these.</p>

<h3 class="main">Hanum&acirc;n as a Village Godling.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But whatever may be the origin of the cult, the fact
remains that he is a great village godling, with potent influence to
scare evil spirits from his votaries. His rude image, smeared with oil
and red ochre, meets one somewhere or other in almost every respectable
Hindu village. One of his functions is to act as an embodiment of
virile power. He is a giver of offspring, and in Bombay women sometimes
go to his temple in the early morning, strip themselves naked, and
embrace the god.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1967src" href="#xd21e1967"
name="xd21e1967src">8</a> Mr. Hartland has collected many instances of
similar practices. Thus a cannon at Batavia used to be utilized in the
same way; and at Athens there is a rock near the Callirrhoe, whereon
women who wish to be made fertile rub themselves, calling on the Moirai
to be gracious to them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1970src" href=
"#xd21e1970" name="xd21e1970src">9</a></p>
<p>On the same principle he is, with Hindu wrestlers, their patron
deity, his place among Musalm&acirc;ns being taken by &rsquo;Ali. Their
aid is invoked at the commencement of all athletic exercises, and at
each wrestling school a platform is erected in their honour. Tuesday is
sacred to Mah&acirc;b&icirc;r and Friday to &rsquo;Ali. Hindu wrestlers
on Mah&acirc;b&icirc;r&rsquo;s day bathe in a river in the morning, and
after bathing dress in clean clothes. Then taking a jar of water, some
incense, sweets, and red or white flowers, they repair to the wrestling
school, bow down before the platform and smear it with cow-dung or
earth. After this the sweets are offered to Mah&acirc;b&icirc;r and
verses are recited in his honour. Then they do the exercise five times
and bow before the platform. When the service is over they smear their
bodies with the incense, which is supposed to give them strength and
courage. Care is taken that no woman sees the athletes exercising, lest
she should cast the Evil Eye upon them.</p>
<p>One special haunt of the monkey deity is what is known as the
Bandarp&ucirc;nchh or &ldquo;monkey tail&rdquo; peak in the
Him&acirc;layas. They say that every year in the spring a single
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>monkey comes from Hardw&acirc;r to this peak and
remains there twelve months, when he makes way for his successor.</p>
<p>Hanum&acirc;n is a favourite deity of the semi-Hinduized
Dr&acirc;vidian races of the Vindhya-Kaim&ucirc;r plateau. &ldquo;The
most awe-inspiring of their tremendous rocks are his fanes; the most
lovely of their pools are sacred by virtue of the tradition of his
having bathed in them.&rdquo; He was known as Pawan-k&acirc;-p&ucirc;t,
or &ldquo;son of the wind,&rdquo; which corresponds to his older title
of Marutputra, or &ldquo;son of the wind god.&rdquo; And the Bhuiyas of
Sinhbh&ucirc;m, who are, as Colonel Dalton gravely remarks,
&ldquo;without doubt the apes of the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana,&rdquo; call
themselves Pawan-bans, or &ldquo;sons of the wind,&rdquo; to this
day.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1981src" href="#xd21e1981" name=
"xd21e1981src">10</a> But in the plains his chief function is as a
warden or guardian against demoniacal influence, and at the
Hanum&acirc;ngarhi shrine at Ajudhya he is provided with a regular
priesthood consisting of Kh&acirc;ki ascetics.</p>
<p>The respect paid to the monkey does not need much illustration. The
ordinary monkey of the plains (<i>Macacus Rhesus</i>) is a most
troublesome, mischievous beast, and does enormous mischief to crops,
while in cities he is little short of a pest. But his life is protected
by a most effective sanction, and no one dares to injure him.</p>
<p>General Sleeman<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1991src" href=
"#xd21e1991" name="xd21e1991src">11</a> tells a story of a Muhammadan
Naw&acirc;b of Oudh, who was believed to have died of fever, the result
of killing a monkey. &ldquo;Mumt&acirc;z-ud-daula,&rdquo; said his
informant, &ldquo;might have been King of Oudh had his father not shot
that monkey.&rdquo; In the Panj&acirc;b an appeal to the monkey
overcomes the demon of the whirlwind. There is a Bombay story that in
the village of Makarg&acirc;on, whenever there is a marriage in a
house, the owner puts outside the wedding booth a turban, a
waist-cloth, rice, fruits, turmeric, and betel-nuts for the village
monkeys. The monkeys assemble and sit round their Patel, or chief. The
chief tears the turban and gives a piece to each of them, and the other
things are divided. If the householder does not present these offerings
they ascend the booth and defile the wedding feast. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>He has
then to come out and apologize, and when he gives them the usual gifts
they retire.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1996src" href="#xd21e1996"
name="xd21e1996src">12</a> The feeding of monkeys is part of the ritual
at the Durg&acirc; Temple at Benares, and there, too, there is a king
of the monkeys who is treated with much respect. Instances of
R&acirc;jas carrying out the wedding of a monkey at enormous expense
are not unknown. Where a monkey has been killed it is believed that no
one can live. His bones are also exceedingly unlucky, and a special
class of exorcisers in Bih&acirc;r make it their business to ascertain
that his bones do not pollute the ground on which a house is about to
be erected.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1999src" href="#xd21e1999" name=
"xd21e1999src">13</a></p>
<p>The worship of Hanum&acirc;n appears, if the Census returns are to
be trusted, to be much more popular in the North-West Provinces than in
the Panj&acirc;b. In the former his devotees numbered about a million,
and in the latter less than ten thousand persons. But the figures are
probably open to question, as he is often worshipped in association
with other deities.</p>

<h3 class="main">Worship of Bh&icirc;msen.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another of these beneficent guardians or wardens is
Bh&icirc;msen, &ldquo;he who has a terrible army.&rdquo; He has now in
popular belief very little in common with the burly hero of the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, who was notorious for his gigantic strength,
great animal courage, prodigious appetite and irascible temper; jovial
and jocular when in good humour, but abusive, truculent and brutal when
his passions were roused.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2009src" href=
"#xd21e2009" name="xd21e2009src">14</a> He is now little more than one
of the wardens of the house or village.</p>
<p>In parts of the Central Provinces he has become degraded into a mere
fetish, and is represented by a piece of iron fixed in a stone or in a
tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2014src" href="#xd21e2014" name=
"xd21e2014src">15</a> Under the name of Bh&icirc;msen or Bh&icirc;mpen,
his worship extends from Ber&acirc;r to the extreme east of Bastar, and
not merely among the Hinduized <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90"
href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>aborigines, who have begun to
honour Khandoba, Hanum&acirc;n, Ganpati and their brethren, but among
the rudest and most savage tribes. He is generally adored under the
form of an unshapely stone covered with vermilion, or of two pieces of
wood standing from three to four feet out of the ground, which are
possibly connected with the phallic idea, towards which so many of
these deities often diverge. Bhiw&acirc;su, the regular Gond deity, is
identical with him. Mr. Hislop<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2019src"
href="#xd21e2019" name="xd21e2019src">16</a> mentions a large idol of
him eight feet high, with a dagger in one hand and a javelin in the
other. He has an aboriginal priest, known as Bh&ucirc;mak, or &ldquo;he
of the soil,&rdquo; and the people repair to worship on Tuesdays and
Saturdays, offering he-goats, hogs, hens, cocks and cocoa-nuts. The
headman of the village and the cultivators subscribe for an annual
feast, which takes place at the commencement of the rains, when the
priest takes a cow from the headman by force and offers it to the
godling in the presence of his congregation. The M&acirc;riya Gonds
worship him in the form of two pieces of wood previous to the sowing of
the crops. The Naikud&ecirc; Gonds adore him in the form of a huge
stone daubed with vermilion. Before it a little rice is cooked. They
then besmear the stone with vermilion and burn resin as incense in its
honour, after which the victims&mdash;sheep, hogs and fowls&mdash;with
the usual oblation of spirits, are offered. The god is now supposed to
inspire the priest, who rolls his head, leaps frantically round and
round, and finally falls down in a trance, when he announces whether
Bh&icirc;msen has accepted the service or not. At night all join in
drinking, dancing and beating drums. Next morning the congregation
disperses. Those who are unable to attend this tribal gathering perform
similar rites at home under the shade of the Mahua tree (<i lang=

edict pillars which were erected by the pious Buddhist King Asoka, but
they have been appropriated by Bh&icirc;msen. Such are the pillars in
the B&acirc;lagh&acirc;t District of the Central Provinces and at
Kah&acirc;on in Gorakhpur. At Devadh&acirc;ra, in the Lower
Him&acirc;laya, are two boulders, the uppermost of which is called
Ransila, or &ldquo;the stone of war.&rdquo; On this rests a smaller
boulder, said to be the same as that used by Bh&icirc;msen to produce
the fissures in the rocks; in proof of which the print of his five
fingers is still pointed out, as they show the hand-mark of the Giant
Bolster in Cornwall.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2035src" href=

<p>Bh&icirc;msen is one of the special gods of the Bhuiyas of Keunjhar,
and they consider themselves to be descended from him, as he is the
brother of Hanum&acirc;n, the founder of their race. According to the
Hindu ritual he has his special feast on the Bhaimy
Ek&acirc;dash&icirc;, or eleventh of the bright fortnight in the month
of M&acirc;gh. The Bengal legend tells that Bh&icirc;msen, the brother
of <span class="corr" id="xd21e2040" title=
"Source: Yudishthira">Yudhisthira</span>, when he was sent to the snowy
mountains and lay benumbed with cold, was restored by the Saint
Gorakhn&acirc;th, and made king of one hundred and ten thousand hills,
stretching from the source of the Ganges to Bhut&acirc;n. Among other
miracles Bh&icirc;msen and Gorakhn&acirc;th introduced the sacrifice of
buffaloes in place of human beings, and in order to effect this
Bh&icirc;msen thrust some of the flesh down the throat of the holy man.
So though they have both lost caste in consequence, they are both
deified. The saint is still the tutelary deity of the reigning family
of Nep&acirc;l, and all over that kingdom and Mithila Bh&icirc;msen is
a very common object of worship. That mysterious personage
Gorakhn&acirc;th flits through religious legend and folk-lore from
post-Vedic to medi&aelig;val times; and little has yet been done to
discover the element of historical truth which underlies an immense
mass of the wildest fiction.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2043src" href=

<h3 class="main">Worship of Bh&icirc;shma.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In about the same rank as Bh&icirc;msen is
Bh&icirc;shma, &ldquo;the terrible one,&rdquo; another hero of the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata. To the Hindu nowadays he is chiefly known by
the tragic circumstances of his death. He was covered all over by the
innumerable arrows discharged at him by Arjuna, and when he fell from
his chariot he was upheld from the ground by the arrows and lay as on a
couch of darts. This Sara-sayya or &ldquo;arrow-bed&rdquo; of
Bh&icirc;shma is probably the origin of the Kantaka-sayya or
&ldquo;thorn-couch&rdquo; of some modern Bair&acirc;gis, who lie and
sleep on a couch studded with nails. He wished to marry the maiden
Satyavat&icirc;, but he gave her up to his father S&acirc;ntanu, and
Bh&icirc;shma elected to live a single life, so that his sons might not
claim the throne from his step-brethren. Hence, as he died childless
and left no descendant to perform his funeral rites, he is worshipped
with libations of water on the Bh&icirc;shma Ashtam&icirc;, or 23rd of
the month of M&acirc;gh; but this ceremony hardly extends beyond
Bengal.</p>
<p>In Upper India five days in the month of K&acirc;rttik
(November-December) are sacred to him. This is a woman&rsquo;s
festival. They send lamps to a Br&acirc;hman&rsquo;s house, whose wife
during these five days must sleep on the ground, on a spot covered with
cow-dung, close to the lamps, which it is her duty to keep alight. The
lamps are filled with sesamum oil, and red wicks wound round sticks of
the sesamum plant rest in the lamp saucers. A walnut, an &acirc;onla
(the fruit of the emblic myrobolon), a lotus-seed, and two copper coins
are placed in each lamp. Each evening the women come and prostrate
themselves before the lamps or walk round them. They bathe on each day
of the feast before sunrise, and are allowed only one meal in the day,
consisting of sugar-cane, sweet potatoes and other roots, with meal
made of amarinth seed, millet and buckwheat cakes, to which the rich
add sugar, dry ginger, and butter. They drink only milk. Of course the
Br&acirc;hman gets a share of these good things, to which the rich
contribute in addition a lamp-saucer made of silver, with a golden
wick, clothes, and money. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>At the early morning bath of the last
day five lighted lamps made of dough are placed, one at the entrance of
the town or village, others at the four cross-roads, under the
P&icirc;pal or sacred fig tree, at a temple of Siva, and at a pond.
This last is put in a small raft made of the leaves of the sugar-cane,
and floated on the water. A little grain is placed beside each lamp.
After the lamps handed over to the Br&acirc;hman have burnt away or
gone out, the black from the wicks is rubbed on the eyes and fingers of
the worshippers, and their toe-nails are anointed with the remainder of
the oil. All the articles used in the worship are well-known scarers of
demons, and there can be little doubt that the rite is intended to
conciliate Bh&icirc;shma in his character of a guardian deity, and
induce him to ward off evil spirits from the household of the
worshipper.</p>
<p>There is a curious legend told to explain the motive of the rite. A
childless R&acirc;ja once threatened to kill all his queens unless one
of them gave birth to a child. One of the R&acirc;n&icirc;s who had a
cat, announced that she had been brought to bed of a girl, who was to
be shut up for twelve years, a common incident in the
folk-tales.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2059src" href="#xd21e2059" name=
"xd21e2059src">20</a> This was all very well, but the supposed princess
had to be married, and here lay the difficulty. Now this cat had been
very attentive during this rite in honour of Bh&icirc;shma, keeping the
wicks alight by raising them from time to time with her paws, and
cleaning them on her body. So the grateful godling turned her into a
beautiful girl, but her tail remained as before. However, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s friends admired her so much that they kept her
secret at the wedding, and so saved the R&acirc;n&icirc; from
destruction, and when the time came for the bride to go to her husband
her tail dropped off too. So Hindu ladies use the oil and lamp-black of
Bh&icirc;shma&rsquo;s feast day as valuable aids to beauty. Such cases
of animal transformation constantly appear in the folk-tales. In one of
the Kashm&icirc;r stories a cat, by the advice of P&acirc;rvat&icirc;,
rubs herself with oil and is turned into a girl; but she does not rub a
small patch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>between her shoulders, and this remained covered
with the cat&rsquo;s fur.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2064src" href=
"#xd21e2064" name="xd21e2064src">21</a></p>
<p>The worship of the heroes of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata does not
prevail widely, unless we have a survival of it in the worship of the
P&acirc;nch P&icirc;r. At the last Census in the North-Western
Provinces less than four thousand persons declared themselves
worshippers of the P&acirc;ndavas. The number in the Panj&acirc;b is
even smaller.</p>

<h3 class="main">Worship of the Local Godlings.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We now come to the local or village godlings, a most
nondescript collection of deities, possessing very various attributes.
There is good reason to believe that most of these deities, if not all,
belong to the races whom it is convenient to call non-Aryan, or at
least outside Br&acirc;hmanism, though some of them may have been from
time to time promoted into the official pantheon. But Dr.
Oppert,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2074src" href="#xd21e2074" name=
"xd21e2074src">22</a> writing of Southern India, remarks that &ldquo;if
the pure Vedic doctrine has been altered by the influx of non-Aryan
tenets, so have also the latter undergone a change by coming in contact
with Aryan ideas, and not only have males intruded into the once
exclusive female circle of the Gr&acirc;madevat&acirc;s, but also a
motley of queer figures have crept in, forming indeed a very strange
gathering. The Gr&acirc;madevat&acirc;-prathishtha mentions as
Gr&acirc;madevat&acirc;s the skull of Brahma, the head of Vishnu, the
skull of Renuk&acirc;, the figure of Draupad&icirc;, the body of
S&icirc;t&acirc;, the harassing followers of Siva (the Pramathas), the
attendants of Vishnu (P&acirc;rishadas), demons, Yogin&icirc;s, various
kinds of S&acirc;ktis made of wood, stone, or clay; persons who were
unsuccessful in their devotional practice, Sunasepha, Trisanku,
Ghatotkacha, and others; Devak&icirc;&rsquo;s daughter, multiform
Durg&acirc;s and S&acirc;ktis; P&ucirc;tan&acirc; and others who kill
children; Bh&ucirc;tas, Pretas, and Pis&acirc;chas;
K&ucirc;sm&acirc;nda, S&acirc;kin&icirc;, D&acirc;kin&icirc;,
Vet&acirc;las, and others; Yakshas, Kir&acirc;tadev&icirc;,
Sabar&icirc;, Rudra, one hundred millions of forms of Rudra;
M&acirc;tang&icirc;, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95"
name="pb95">95</a>]</span>Sy&acirc;mal&acirc;, unclean Ganapati,
unclean Ch&acirc;ndal&icirc;, the goddess of the liquor pot
(Surabhandeswar&icirc;), Mohin&icirc;, R&acirc;kshas&icirc;,
Tripur&acirc;, Lankhin&icirc;, Saubhadev&icirc;, S&acirc;mudrik&acirc;,
Vanadurg&acirc;, Jaladurg&acirc;, Agnidurg&acirc;, suicides, culprits,
faithful wives, the goddesses of matter, goddesses of qualities, and
goddesses of deeds, etc.&rdquo; Through such a maze as this it is no
easy task to find a clue.</p>
<p>The non-Br&acirc;hmanic character of the worship is implied by the
character of the priesthood. In the neighbourhood of Delhi, where the
worship of Bh&ucirc;miya as a local godling widely prevails, the
so-called priest of the shrine, whose functions are limited to beating
a drum during the service and receiving the offerings, is usually of
the sweeper caste. S&icirc;tal&acirc;, the small-pox goddess, is very
often served by a M&acirc;li, or gardener. Sir John Malcolm notes that
the Bhopa of Central India, who acts as the village priest, is
generally drawn from some menial tribe.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2081src" href="#xd21e2081" name="xd21e2081src">23</a> In the hill
country of South Mirzapur, the Baiga who manages the worship of
Gans&acirc;m, R&acirc;ja L&acirc;khan, or the aggregate of the local
deities, known as the Dih or Deoh&acirc;r, is almost invariably a
Bhuiy&acirc;r or a Chero, both semi-savage Dr&acirc;vidian tribes. Even
the shrine erected in honour of N&acirc;har R&acirc;o, the famous King
of Mandor, who met in equal combat the chivalrous Chauh&acirc;n in the
pass of the Aravalli range, is tended by a barber officiant.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2084src" href="#xd21e2084" name=
"xd21e2084src">24</a> Though the votaries of the meaner godling are
looked on with some contempt or pity by their more respectable
neighbours, little active hostility or intolerance is exhibited. More
than this, the higher classes, and particularly their women,
occasionally join in the worship of the older gods. At weddings and
other feasts their aid and protection are invoked. Every woman, no
matter what her caste may be, will bow to the ghosts which haunt the
old banyan or p&icirc;pal tree in the village, and in time of trouble,
when the clouds withhold the rain, when the pestilence walketh in
darkness, and the murrain devastates the herds, it is to the patron
deities of the village that they appeal for assistance. <span class=

<h3 class="main">Village Shrines.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The shrine of the regular village godling, the
Gr&acirc;madevat&acirc; or Ganwdevat&acirc;, is generally a small
square building of brick masonry, with a bulbous head and perhaps an
iron spike as a finial. A red flag hung on an adjoining tree, often a
p&icirc;pal, or some other sacred fig, or a n&icirc;m, marks the
position of the shrine. In the interior lamps are occasionally lighted,
fire sacrifices (<i>homa</i>) made and petty offerings presented. If a
victim is offered, its head is cut off outside the shrine and perhaps a
few drops of blood allowed to fall on the inner platform, which is the
seat of the godling. These shrines never contain a special image, such
as are found in the temples of the higher gods. There may be a few
carved stones lying about, the relics of some dismantled temple, but
these are seldom identified with any special deity, and villagers will
rub a projecting knob on one of them with a little vermilion and oil as
an act of worship.</p>
<p>Speaking of this class of shrine in the Panj&acirc;b, Mr. Ibbetson
writes:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2099src" href="#xd21e2099" name=
"xd21e2099src">25</a> &ldquo;The Hindu shrine must always face east,
while the Musalm&acirc;n shrine is in the form of a tomb and faces the
south. This sometimes gives rise to delicate questions. In one village
a section of the community had become Muhammadan. The shrine of the
common ancestor needed rebuilding, and there was much dispute as to its
shape and aspect. They solved the difficulty by building a
Musalm&acirc;n grave facing south, and over it a Hindu shrine facing
east. In another village an Imperial trooper was once burnt alive by
the shed in which he was sleeping catching fire, and it was thought
best to propitiate him by a shrine, or his ghost might become
troublesome. He was by religion a Musalm&acirc;n, but he had been
burnt, not buried, which seemed to make him a Hindu. After much
discussion the latter opinion prevailed, and a Hindu shrine with an
eastern aspect now stands to his memory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2103width"><img src="images/p1096.jpg" alt=
"A VILLAGE SHRINE." width="720" height="423">
<p class="figureHead">A VILLAGE SHRINE.</p>
</div>
<p>To the east of the North-Western Provinces the village shrines are
much less substantial erections. In the Gangetic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>valley,
where the population has been completely Hinduized, the shrine of the
collective village deities, known as the Deoh&acirc;r, consists of a
pile of stones, some of which may be the fragments of a temple of the
olden days, collected under some ancient, sacred tree. The shrine is
the store-house of anything in the way of a curious stone to be found
in the village, water-worn pebbles or boulders, anything with eccentric
veining or marking. Here have been occasionally found celts and stone
hatchets, relics of an age anterior to the general use of iron. In the
same way in some European countries the celt or stone arrow-head is
worn as an amulet.</p>
<p>Little clay images of elephants and horses are often found near
these shrines. Some villagers will say that these represent the
equipage (<i>saw&acirc;r&icirc;</i>) of the deity; others explain them
by the fact that a person in distress vows a horse or an elephant to
the god, and when his wishes are realized, offers as a substitute this
trumpery donation. It was a common practice to offer substitutes of
this kind. Thus when an animal could not be procured for sacrifice, an
image of it in dough or wax was prepared and offered as a
substitute.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2116src" href="#xd21e2116" name=
"xd21e2116src">26</a> We shall meet later on other examples of
substitution of the same kind. On the same principle women used to give
cakes in the form of a phallus to a Br&acirc;hman.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2119src" href="#xd21e2119" name="xd21e2119src">27</a> At these
shrines are also found curious little clay bowls with short legs which
are known as kalsa. The kalsa or water jar is always placed near the
pole of the marriage shed, and the use of these beehive-shaped vessels
at village shrines is found all along the hills of Central
India.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2122src" href="#xd21e2122" name=
"xd21e2122src">28</a> On the neighbouring trees are often hung
miniature cots, which commemorate the recovery of a patient from
small-pox or other infectious disease.</p>
<p>Among the semi-Hinduized Dr&acirc;vidian races of the Vindhyan
range, many of whom worship Gans&acirc;m or R&acirc;ja L&acirc;khan,
the shrine usually consists of a rude mud building or a structure made
of bamboo and straw, roofed with a coarse <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>thatch, which is often
allowed to fall into disrepair, until the godling reminds his votaries
of his displeasure by an outbreak of epidemic disease or some other
misfortune which attacks the village. The shrine is in charge of the
village Baiga, who is invariably selected from among some of the ruder
forest tribes, such as the Bhuiya, Bhuiy&acirc;r or Chero. Inside is a
small platform known as &ldquo;the seat of the godling&rdquo; (<i lang=
"hi-latn">Devat&acirc; k&acirc; baithak</i>), on which are usually
placed some of the curious earthen bowls already described, which are
made specially for this worship, and are not used for domestic
purposes. In these water is placed for the refreshment of the godling,
and they thus resemble the funeral vases of the Greeks. In ordinary
cases the offering deposited on the platform consists of <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2132" title="Source: a a">a</span> thick griddle cake,
a little milk, and perhaps a few jungle flowers; but in more serious
cases where the deity makes his presence disagreeably felt, he is
propitiated with a goat, pig, or fowl, which is decapitated outside the
shrine, with the national and sacrificial axe. The head is brought
inside dripping with blood, and a few drops of blood are allowed to
fall on the platform. The head of the victim then becomes the
perquisite of the officiating Baiga, and the rest of the meat is cooked
and eaten near the shrine by the adult male worshippers, married women
and children being carefully excluded from a share in the offering. The
special regard paid to the head of the victim is quite in consonance
with traditions of European paganism and folk-lore in many
countries.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2135src" href="#xd21e2135" name=
"xd21e2135src">29</a> Lower south, beyond the river Son, the shrine is
of even a simpler type, and is there often represented by a few
boulders near a stream, where the worshippers assemble and make their
offerings.</p>
<p>The non-Br&acirc;hmanic character of the worship is still further
marked by the fact that no special direction from the homestead is
prescribed in selecting the site for the shrine. No orthodox Hindu
temple can be built south of the village site, as this quarter is
regarded as the realm of Yama, the god of death; here vagrant evil
spirits prowl and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99"
name="pb99">99</a>]</span>consume or defile the offerings made to the
greater gods. In the more Hinduized jungle villages some attempt is
occasionally made to conform to this rule, and sometimes, as in the
case of the more respectable Hindu shrines, the door faces the east.
But this rule is not universal, and the site of the shrine is often
selected under some suitable tree, whatever may be its position as
regards the homestead, and it very often commemorates some
half-forgotten tragedy, where a man was carried off by a tiger or slain
or murdered, where he fell from a tree or was drowned in a watercourse.
Here some sort of shrine is generally erected with the object of
appeasing the angry spirit of the dead man.</p>
<p>These shrines have no idol, no bell to scare vagrant ghosts and
awake the godling to partake of the offerings or listen to the prayers
of his votaries. If he is believed to be absent or asleep, a drum is
beaten to awaken or recall him, and this answers the additional purpose
of scaring off intruding spirits, who are always hungry and on the
watch to appropriate the offerings of the faithful. Here are also none
of the sacrificial vessels, brazen lamps and cups, which are largely
used in respectable fanes for waving a light before the deity as part
of the service, or for cooling the idol with libations of water, and
the instrument used for sacrificing the victim is only the ordinary axe
which the dweller in the jungle always carries.</p>
<p>There is one special implement which is very commonly found in the
village shrines of the hill country south of the Ganges. This is an
iron chain with a heavy knob at the end, to which a strap, like a
Scotch tawse, is often attached. The chain is ordinarily three and a
half feet long, the tawse two feet, and the total weight is about seven
pounds. This is known as the Gurda; it hangs from the roof of the
shrine, and is believed to be directly under the influence of the
deity, so that it is very difficult to procure a specimen. The Baiga
priest, when his services are required for the exorcism of a disease
ghost, thrashes himself on the back and loins with his chain, until he
works himself up to the proper degree of religious ecstasy.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>Among the more primitive Gonds the chain has become a godling and is
regularly worshipped. In serious cases of epilepsy, hysteria, and the
like, which do not readily yield to ordinary exorcism, the patient is
taken to the shrine and severely beaten with the holy chain until the
demon is expelled. This treatment is, I understand, considered
particularly effective in the case of hysteria and kindred ailments
under which young women are wont to suffer, and like the use of the
thong at the Lupercalia at Rome, a few blows of the chain are
considered advisable as a remedy for barrenness. The custom of
castigating girls when they attain puberty prevails among many races of
savages.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2149src" href="#xd21e2149" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Identification of the Local Godling.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The business of selecting a site for a new village or
hamlet is one which needs infinite care and attention to the local
godlings of the place. No place can be chosen without special regard to
the local omens. There is a story told of one of the Gond R&acirc;jas
of Garh Mandla, whose attention was first called to the place by seeing
a hare, when pursued by his dogs, turn and chase them. It struck him
that there must be much virtue in the air of a place where a timid
animal acquired such courage.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2158src" href=
"#xd21e2158" name="xd21e2158src">31</a> The site of the settlement of
Almora is said to have been selected by one of the kings before whom in
this place a hare was transformed into a tiger.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2161src" href="#xd21e2161" name="xd21e2161src">32</a> Similar
legends are told of the foundation of many forts and cities.</p>
<p>But it is with the local godlings that the founder of a new
settlement has most concern. The speciality of this class of godlings
is that they frequent only particular places. Each has his separate
jurisdiction, which includes generally one or sometimes a group of
villages. This idea has doubtless promoted the rooted disinclination of
the Hindu to leave his home and come into the domain of a fresh set of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>godlings with whom he has no acquaintance, who
have never received due propitiation from him or his forefathers, and
who are hence in all probability inimical to him. But people to whom
the local godling of their village has shown his hostility by bringing
affliction upon them for their neglect of his service, can usually
escape from his malignity by leaving his district. This habit of
emigration to escape the malignity of the offended godling doubtless
accounts for many of the sites of deserted villages, which are
scattered all over the country. We say that they were abandoned on
account of a great famine or a severe epidemic, but to the native mind
these afflictions are the work of the local deity, who could have
warded them off had he been so disposed. Hence when a settlement is
being founded it is a matter of prime necessity that the local godling
or group of godlings should be brought under proper control and
carefully identified, so as to ensure the safety and prosperity of the
settlement. The next and final stage is the establishment of a suitable
shrine and the appointment of a competent priest.</p>
<p>There are, as might have been expected, many methods of identifying
and establishing the local gods. Thus in North Oudh, when a village is
founded the site is marked off by cross stakes of wood driven into the
ground, which are solemnly worshipped on the day of the completion of
the settlement, and then lapse into neglect unless some indication of
the displeasure of the god again direct attention to them. These
crosses, which are called Daharchand&icirc;, are particularly frequent
and well-marked in the villages occupied by the aboriginal Th&acirc;rus
in the sub-Him&acirc;layan Tar&acirc;&icirc;, where they may be found
in groups of ten or more on the edge of the cultivated lands. So, among
the Sant&acirc;ls, a piece of split bamboo, about three feet high, is
placed in the ground in an inclined position and is called the
Sip&acirc;h&icirc; or sentinel of the hamlet; among the Gonds two
curved posts, one of which is much smaller than the other, represent
the male and female tutelary gods.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2170src"
href="#xd21e2170" name="xd21e2170src">33</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Eastern Districts of the North-Western Provinces a more
elaborate process is carried out, which admirably illustrates the
special form of local worship now under consideration. When the site of
a new settlement is selected, an Ojha is called in to identify and mark
down the deities of the place. He begins by beating a drum round the
place for some time, which is intended to scare vagrant, outsider
ghosts and to call together the local deities. All the people assemble,
and two men, known as the Mattiw&acirc;h and the Pattiw&acirc;h,
&ldquo;the earth man&rdquo; and &ldquo;the leaf man,&rdquo; who
represent the gods of the soil and of the trees, soon become filled
with the spirit and are found to be possessed by the local deities.
They dance and shout for some time in a state of religious frenzy, and
their disconnected ejaculations are interpreted by the Ojha, who
suddenly rushes upon them, grasps with his hands at the spirits which
are supposed to be circling round them, and finally pours through their
hands some grains of sesamum, which is received in a perforated piece
of the wood of the G&ucirc;lar or sacred fig-tree. The whole is
immediately plastered up with a mixture of clay and cow-dung, and the
wood is carefully buried on the site selected for the Deoh&acirc;r or
local shrine. By this process the deities are supposed to be fastened
up in the sacred wood and to be unable to do any mischief, provided
that the usual periodical offerings are made in their honour.</p>
<p>This system does not seem to prevail among the Dr&acirc;vidian races
of the Vindhyan plateau. Some time ago I discussed the matter with
Hannu Baiga, the chief priest of the Bhuiyas beyond the Son, and he was
pleased to express his unqualified approval of the arrangement. Indeed,
he promised to adopt it himself, but unfortunately Hannu, who was a
mine of information on the religion and demonology of his people, died
before he could apply this test to the local deities of his parish. His
wife has died also, and I understand that he is known to be the head of
all the Bh&ucirc;ts or malignant ghosts of the neighbourhood, while his
wife rules all the Churels who infest that part of the country.</p>
<p>At the same time, to an ordinary Baiga the plan would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>hardly be as comfortable as the present
arrangement. It would not suit him to have the local ghosts brought
under any control, because he makes his living by doing the periodical
services to propitiate them. Nowadays he believes fully in the
influence of the magic circle and of spirituous liquor as ghost
scarers. Both these principles will be discussed elsewhere. So he is
supposed once a year at least, or oftener in case of pestilence or
other trouble, to perambulate all round the village boundary,
sprinkling a line of spirits as he walks. The idea is to form a magic
circle impervious to strange and, in the nature of the case,
necessarily malignant ghosts, who might wish to intrude from outside;
and to control the resident local deities, and prevent them from
contracting evil habits of mischief by wandering beyond their
prescribed domains.</p>
<p>The worst about this ritual is that the Baiga is apt to be very
deliberate in his movements, and to drink the liquor on the road and to
spoil the symmetry of the circle during his fits of intoxication. I
know of one disreputable shepherd who was upwards of a fortnight
getting round an ordinary sized village, and the levy on his
parishioners to pay the wine bill was, as may easily be imagined, a
very serious matter, to say nothing of several calamities, which
occurred to the inhabitants in their unprotected state owing to his
negligence. At present the feeling in his parish is very strong against
him, and his constituents are thinking of removing him, particularly as
he has only one eye. This is a very dangerous deformity in ordinary
people, but in a Baiga, who is invested with religious functions, it is
most objectionable, and likely to detract from his efficiency.</p>
<p>In Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d a different system prevails. When a new
village is formed by the aboriginal Kurkus, there is no difficulty in
finding the abode of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e2186" title=
"Source: godling">godlings</span> D&ucirc;ngar Devat&acirc; and
M&acirc;t&acirc;, because you have only to look for and discover them
upon their hill and under their tree. But Mutua Devat&acirc; has
generally to be created by taking a heap of stones from the nearest
stream and sacrificing a pig and seven chickens to him. &ldquo;There is
one ceremony, however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>which is worth notice, not so much
as being distinctively Kurku, as illustrating the sense of mystery and
chance which in the native mind seems to be connected with the idea of
measurement, and which arises probably from the fact that with
superficial measures, by heaping lightly or pressing down tight, very
different results can be obtained. A measure is filled up with grain to
the level of the brim, but no head is poured on, and it is put before
Mutua Devat&acirc;. They watch it all night, and in the morning pour it
out, and measure it again. If the grain now fills up the measure and
leaves enough for a head to it, and still more, if it brims and runs
over, this is a sign that the village will be very prosperous, and that
every cultivator&rsquo;s granaries will run over in the same way. But
it is an evil omen if the grain does not fill up to the level of the
rims of the vessel. A similar practice obtains in the Narmad&acirc;
valley when they begin winnowing, and some repeat it every night while
the winnowing goes on.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2191src" href=
"#xd21e2191" name="xd21e2191src">34</a></p>
<p>The same custom prevails among the Kols and kindred races in
Mirzapur, who make the bride and bridegroom carry it out as an omen of
their success or failure in life. By carefully packing and pressing
down the grain, any chance of an evil augury is easily avoided. We
shall see later on that measuring the grain is a favourite device
intended to save it from the depredations of evil-minded ghosts.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Worship of Bh&ucirc;miya.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the most characteristic of the benevolent
village godlings is Bh&ucirc;miya&mdash;&ldquo;the godling of the land
or soil&rdquo; (<i>bh&ucirc;mi</i>). He is very commonly known as
Khetp&acirc;l or Kshetrap&acirc;la, &ldquo;the protector of the
fields&rdquo;; Khera or &ldquo;the homestead mound&rdquo;;
Zam&icirc;nd&acirc;r or &ldquo;the landowner&rdquo;; and in the hills
S&acirc;im or S&acirc;yam, &ldquo;the black one&rdquo; (Sanskrit
<i>sy&acirc;ma</i>). In the neighbourhood of Delhi he is a male
godling; in Oudh Bh&ucirc;miy&acirc; is a goddess and is called
Bh&ucirc;miy&acirc; R&acirc;n&icirc; or &ldquo;soil queen.&rdquo; She
is worshipped by spreading flat cakes and sweetmeats on the ground,
which having been exposed some time to the sun, are eventually consumed
by the worshipper and his family. The rite obviously implies the close
connection between the fertility of the soil and sunshine.</p>
<p>To the west of the Province the creation of Bh&ucirc;miya&rsquo;s
shrine is &ldquo;the first formal act by which the proposed site of a
village is consecrated, and when two villages have combined their
homesteads for greater security against the marauders of former days,
the people of the one which moved still worship at the Bh&ucirc;miya of
the deserted site. Bh&ucirc;miya is worshipped after the harvests, at
marriages, and on the birth of a male child; and Br&acirc;hmans are
commonly fed in his name. Women often take their children to the shrine
on Sundays, and the first milk of a cow or buffalo is always offered
there.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2230src" href="#xd21e2230"
name="xd21e2230src">38</a> Young bulls are sometimes released
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>in his honour, and the term <i>Bh&ucirc;miya
s&acirc;nd</i> has come to be equivalent to our &ldquo;parish
bull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Hills he is regarded by some as a beneficent deity, who does
not, as a rule, force his worship on anyone by possessing them or
injuring their crops. When seed is sown, a handful of grain is
sprinkled over a stone in the field nearest to his shrine, in order to
protect the crop from hail, blight, and the ravages of wild animals,
and at harvest time he receives the first-fruits to protect the
garnered grain from rats and insects. He punishes the wicked and
rewards the virtuous, and is lord of the village, always interested in
its prosperity, and a partaker in the good things provided on all
occasions of rejoicing, such as marriage, the birth of a son, or any
great good fortune. Unlike the other rural deities, he seldom receives
animal sacrifices, but is satisfied with the humblest offering of the
fruits of the earth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2240src" href=
"#xd21e2240" name="xd21e2240src">39</a></p>
<p>In Gurg&acirc;on, again, he is very generally identified with one of
the founders of the village or with a Br&acirc;hman priest of the
original settlers. The special day for making offerings to him is the
fourteenth day of the month. Some of the Bh&ucirc;miyas are said to
grant the prayers of their votaries and to punish severely those who
offend them. He visits people who sleep in the vicinity of his shrine
with pains in the chest, and one man who was rash enough to clean his
teeth near his shrine was attacked with sore disease. Those
Bh&ucirc;miyas who thus bear the reputation of being revengeful and
vicious in temper are respected, and offerings to them are often made,
while those who have the character of easy good-nature are
neglected.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2245src" href="#xd21e2245" name=
"xd21e2245src">40</a></p>
<p>In parts of the Panj&acirc;b<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2250src"
href="#xd21e2250" name="xd21e2250src">41</a> Khera Devat&acirc; or
Ch&acirc;nwand is identified with Bh&ucirc;miya; according to another
account she is a lady and the wife of Bh&ucirc;miya, and she sometimes
has a special shrine, and is worshipped on Sunday only. To illustrate
the close connection between this worship of Bh&ucirc;miya as the soil
godling with that of the sainted dead, it may be noted that in some
places the shrine of Bh&ucirc;miya is identified with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>the
Jathera, which is the ancestral mound, sacred to the common ancestor of
the village or tribe. One of the most celebrated of these Jatheras is
K&acirc;la Mahar, the ancestor of the Sindhu J&acirc;ts, who has
peculiar influence over cows, and to whom the first milk of every cow
is offered. The place of the Jathera is, however, often taken by the
Theh or mound which marks the site of the original village of the
tribe.</p>
<p>But Bh&ucirc;miya, a simple village godling, is already well on his
way to promotion to the higher heaven. In Patna some have already begun
to identify him with Vishnu. In the Hills the same process is going on,
and he is beginning to be known as S&acirc;im, a corruption of
Svayambhuva, the Bauddha form now worshipped in Nep&acirc;l. In the
plains he is becoming promoted under the title of
Bh&ucirc;m&icirc;svara Mah&acirc;deva and his spouse
Bh&ucirc;m&icirc;svar&icirc; Dev&icirc;, both of whom have temples at
B&acirc;nda.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2257src" href="#xd21e2257"
name="xd21e2257src">42</a> In the Hills it is believed that he
sometimes possesses people, and the sign of this is that the hair of
the scalplock becomes hopelessly entangled. This reminds us of that
very Mab &ldquo;that plaits the manes of horses in the night and bakes
the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, which once untangled much
misfortune bodes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a common English belief that all who have communication with
fairies find their hair all tied in double knots.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2262src" href="#xd21e2262" name="xd21e2262src">43</a> As we shall
see later on, the hair is universally regarded as an entry for spirits,
perhaps, as Mr. Campbell suggests, because it leads to the opening in
the skull through which the dying spirit makes its exit. Hence many of
the customs connected with letting the hair loose, cutting it off or
shaving.</p>
<p>No less than eighty-five thousand persons declared themselves, at
the last census, to be worshippers of Bh&ucirc;miya in the
North-Western Provinces, while in the Panj&acirc;b they numbered only
one hundred and sixty-three.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Worship of Bhairon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bh&ucirc;miya, again, is often confounded with
Bhairon, another warden godling of the land; while, to illustrate the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>extraordinary jumble of these mythologies,
Bhairon, who is almost certainly the K&acirc;ro Bairo (K&acirc;l
Bhairon) of the Bhuiyas of Keunjhar, is identified by them with
Bh&icirc;msen.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2274src" href="#xd21e2274"
name="xd21e2274src">44</a></p>
<p>Bhairon has a curious history. There is little doubt that he was
originally a simple village deity; but with a slight change of name he
has been adopted into Br&acirc;hmanism as Bhairava, &ldquo;the terrible
one,&rdquo; one of the most awful forms of Siva, while the female form
Bhairav&icirc; is an equivalent for Dev&icirc;, a worship specially
prevalent among Jogis and S&acirc;ktas. On the other hand, the Jainas
worship Bhairava as the protector or agent of the Jaina church and
community, and do not offer him flesh and blood sacrifices, but fruits
and sweetmeats.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2279src" href="#xd21e2279"
name="xd21e2279src">45</a></p>
<p>In his Saiva form he is often called Sv&acirc;sva, or &ldquo;he who
rides on a dog,&rdquo; and this vehicle of his marks him down at once
as an offshoot from the village Bhairon, because all through Upper
India the favourite method of conciliating Bhairon is to feed a black
dog until he is surfeited.</p>
<p>One of his distinctive forms is K&acirc;l Bhairon, or K&acirc;la
Bhairava, whose image depicted with his dog is often found as a sort of
warden in Saiva temples. One of his most famous shrines is at Kalinjar,
of which Abul Fazl says &ldquo;marvellous tales are
related.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2286src" href="#xd21e2286"
name="xd21e2286src">46</a> He is depicted with eighteen arms and is
ornamented with the usual garlands of skulls, with snake earrings and
snake armlets and a serpent twined round his head. In his hands he
holds a sword and a bowl of blood. In the Panj&acirc;b he is said to
frighten away death, and in R&acirc;jput&acirc;na Col. Tod calls him
&ldquo;the blood-stained divinity of war.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2289src" href="#xd21e2289" name="xd21e2289src">47</a> The same
godling is known in Bombay as Bhairoba, of whom Mr. Campbell<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2292src" href="#xd21e2292" name=
"xd21e2292src">48</a> writes&mdash;&ldquo;He is represented as a
standing male figure with a trident in the left hand and a drum
(<i>damaru</i>) in the right, and encircled with a serpent. When thus
represented he is called K&acirc;la Bhairava. But generally he is
represented by a rough stone covered over with oil and red lead. He is
said to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>very terrible, and, when offended, difficult to
be pleased. By some he is believed to be an incarnation of Siva
himself, and by others as a spirit much in favour with the god Siva. He
is also consulted as an oracle. When anyone is desirous of ascertaining
whether anything he is about to undertake will turn out according to
his wishes, he sticks two unbroken betel-nuts, one on each breast of
the stone image of Bhairava, and tells it, if his wish is to be
accomplished, that the right or left nut is to fall first. It is said,
like other spirits, Bhairava is not a subordinate of Vet&acirc;la, and
that when he sets out on his circuit at night, he rides a black horse
and is accompanied by a black dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Panj&acirc;b he<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2302src" href=
"#xd21e2302" name="xd21e2302src">49</a> is usually represented as an
inferior deity, a stout black figure, with a bottle of wine in his
hand; he is an evil spirit, and his followers drink wine and eat meat.
One set of ascetics, akin to the Jogis, besmear themselves with red
powder and oil and go about begging and singing the praises of Bhairon,
with bells or gongs hung about their loins and striking themselves with
whips. They are found mainly in large towns, and are not celibates.
Their chief place of pilgrimage is the Girn&acirc;r Hill in
K&acirc;thiaw&acirc;r. That very old temple, the Bhairon K&acirc;
Asth&acirc;n near Lahore, is so named from a quaint legend regarding
Bhairon, connected with its foundation. In the old days the
Dh&icirc;nw&acirc;r girls of Riw&acirc;ri used to be married to the
godling at Bandoda, but they always died soon after, and the custom has
been abandoned. We shall meet later on other instances of the marriage
of girls to a god.</p>
<p>As a village godling Bhairon appears in various forms as L&acirc;th
Bhairon or &ldquo;Bhairon of the club,&rdquo; which approximates him to
Bh&icirc;msen, Battuk Bhairon or &ldquo;the child Bhairon,&rdquo; and
Nand Bhairon, in which we may possibly trace a connection with the
legend of the divine child Krishna and his foster-father Nanda. In
Benares, again, he is known as Bhaironn&acirc;th or &ldquo;Lord
Bhairon,&rdquo; and Bh&ucirc;t Bhairon, &ldquo;Ghost Bhairon,&rdquo;
and he is regarded as the deified magistrate <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>of
the city, who guards all the temples of Siva and saves his votaries
from demons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2309src" href="#xd21e2309"
name="xd21e2309src">50</a></p>
<p>But in his original character as a simple village godling Bhairon is
worshipped with milk and sweetmeats as the protector of fields, cattle
and homestead. Some worship him by pouring spirits at his shrine and
drinking there; and on a new house being built, he is propitiated to
expel the local ghosts. He is respected even by Muhammadans as the
minister of the great saint Sakhi Sarwar, and in this connection is
usually known as Bhairon Jati or &ldquo;Bhairon the
chaste.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2314src" href="#xd21e2314"
name="xd21e2314src">51</a> But as we have seen, he is becoming rapidly
promoted into the more respectable cabinet of the gods, and his
apotheosis will possibly finally take place at the great Saiva shrine
of Mandh&acirc;ta on the Narmad&acirc;, with which a local legend
closely connects him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2317src" href=
"#xd21e2317" name="xd21e2317src">52</a> All over Northern India his
stone fetish is found in close connection with the images of the
greater gods, to whom he acts the part of guardian, and this, as we
have already seen, probably marks a stage in his promotion.</p>
<p>He has, according to the last census, only five thousand followers
in the Panj&acirc;b, as compared with one hundred and and seventy-five
thousand in the North-Western Provinces.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Worship of Ganesa.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On pretty much the same stage as these warden godlings
whom we have been considering is Ganesa, whose name means &ldquo;lord
of the Ganas&rdquo; or inferior deities, especially those in attendance
on Siva. He is represented as a short, fat man, of a yellow colour,
with a protuberant belly, four hands, and the head of an elephant with
a single tusk. P&acirc;rvat&icirc; is said to have formed him from the
scurf of her body, and so proud was she of her offspring that she
showed him to the ill-omened Sani, who when he looked at him reduced
his head to ashes. Brahma advised her to replace the head with the
first she could find, and the first she found <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>was
that of an elephant. Another story says that Ganesa&rsquo;s head was
that of the elephant of Indra, and that one of his tusks was broken off
by the axe of Parasur&acirc;ma. Ganesa is the god of learning, the
patron of undertakings and the remover of obstacles. Hence he is
worshipped at marriages, and his quaint figure stands over the house
door and the entrance of the greater temples. But there can be little
doubt that he, too, is an importation from the indigenous mythology.
His elephant head and the rat as his vehicle suggest that his worship
arose from the primitive animal cultus.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Worship of the Great Mothers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From these generally benevolent village godlings we
pass on to a very obscure form of local worship, that of the Great
Mothers. It prevails both in Aryan and Semetic lands,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2339src" href="#xd21e2339" name="xd21e2339src">53</a> and
there can be very little doubt that it is founded on some of the very
earliest beliefs of the human race. No great religion is without its
deified woman, the Virgin, M&acirc;y&acirc;, R&acirc;dh&acirc;,
F&acirc;timah, and it has been suggested that the cultus has come down
from a time before the present organization of the family came into
existence, and when descent through the mother was the only recognized
form.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2342src" href="#xd21e2342" name=
"xd21e2342src">54</a></p>
<p>We have already met instances of this mother-worship in the case of
Gang&acirc; M&acirc;&icirc;, &ldquo;Mother Ganges,&rdquo; and
Dhart&icirc; M&acirc;t&acirc;, &ldquo;the Earth Mother.&rdquo; We shall
meet it again in S&icirc;tal&acirc; M&acirc;t&acirc;, &ldquo;the
small-pox Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the old mythology Adit&icirc;, or infinite space, was regarded as
the Eternal Mother, and Pr&acirc;krit&icirc; was the Eternal Mother,
capable of evolving all created things out of herself, but never so
creating unless united with the eternal spirit principle embodied in
the Eternal Male, Parusha. There appears to have been a tendency on the
part of the Indo-Germanic race to look upon their deities as belonging
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>both sexes at once, and hence the dualistic idea
in Br&acirc;hmanism of Ardhanari, or the androgynous Siva.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2351src" href="#xd21e2351" name=
"xd21e2351src">55</a></p>
<p>We shall meet later on with the ghost of the unpurified mother, the
Churel, which is based on a different but cognate association of ideas.
Akin to this, again, is the worship of the Sat&icirc;, or model wife,
to which we shall refer again, and that of the Ch&acirc;ran women of
Gujar&acirc;t, who were obliged to immolate themselves to prevent
outrage from the Kolis and other freebooters.</p>
<p>This worship, probably derived from one of the so-called non-Aryan
races, was subsequently developed into that of the female energies of
the greater gods, a Br&acirc;hm&acirc;n&icirc; of Brahma,
Indr&acirc;n&icirc; of Indra, and so on; and thus the simple worship of
the mother has developed and degenerated into the abominations of the
Tantras. These mothers are usually regarded as eight in number, the
Ashta M&acirc;tr&icirc;, but the enumeration of them varies. Sometimes
there are only seven&mdash;Br&acirc;hm&icirc; or
Br&acirc;hm&acirc;n&icirc;, Maheshvar&icirc;, Kaum&acirc;r&icirc;,
Vaishnav&icirc;, V&acirc;r&acirc;h&icirc;, Indr&acirc;n&icirc; or
Aindr&acirc;n&icirc;, or Mahendr&icirc; and Ch&acirc;mund&acirc;.
Sometimes the number is nine&mdash;Br&acirc;hm&acirc;n&icirc;,
Vaishnav&icirc;, Raudr&icirc;, V&acirc;r&acirc;h&icirc;,
Narasinhik&acirc;, Kaum&acirc;r&icirc;, Mahendr&icirc;,
Ch&acirc;mund&acirc;, Chandik&acirc;. Sometimes
sixteen&mdash;Gaur&icirc;, Padm&acirc;, Sach&icirc;, Medh&acirc;,
Savitr&icirc;, Vijay&acirc;, Jay&acirc;, Devasen&acirc;, Svadh&acirc;,
Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, S&acirc;nt&icirc;, Pusht&icirc;, Dhrit&icirc;,

<h3 class="main">Mother-worship in Gujar&acirc;t.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But it is in Gujar&acirc;t that this form of worship
prevails most widely at the present day. Sir Monier-Williams enumerates
about one hundred and forty distinct Mothers, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>besides numerous varieties of the more popular
forms. They are probably all local deities of the Churel type, who have
been adopted into Br&acirc;hmanism. Some are represented by rudely
carved images, others by simple shrines, and others are remarkable for
preferring empty shrines, and the absence of all visible
representations. Each has special functions. Thus one called
Khodi&acirc;r, or &ldquo;mischief,&rdquo; is said to cause trouble
unless propitiated; another called Ant&acirc;&icirc; causes and
prevents whooping cough; another named Ber&acirc;&icirc; prevents
cholera; another called Marak&icirc; causes cholera;
Hadak&acirc;&icirc; controls mad dogs and prevents hydrophobia;
Asapur&acirc;, represented by two idols, satisfies the hopes of wives
by giving children. Not a few are worshipped either as causing or
preventing demoniacal possession as a form of disease. The offering of
a goat&rsquo;s blood to some of these Mothers is regarded as very
effectual. A story is told of a Hindu doctor who cured a whole village
of an outbreak of violent influenza, attributed to the malignant
influence of an angry Mother goddess, by simply assembling the
inhabitants, muttering some cabalistic texts, and solemnly letting
loose a pair of scapegoats in a neighbouring wood as an offering to the
offended deity. One of these Mothers is connected with the curious
custom of the Couvade, which will be discussed later on.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2368src" href="#xd21e2368" name=
"xd21e2368src">57</a> Another famous Gujar&acirc;t Mother is Amb&acirc;
Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;. On the eighth night of the Naur&acirc;tra the
R&acirc;na of Danta attends the worship, fans the goddess with a
horsehair fly-flapper, celebrates the fire sacrifice, and fills with
sweetmeats a huge cauldron, which, on the fall of the garland from the
neck of the goddess, the Bh&icirc;ls empty. Among the offerings to her
are animal sacrifice and spirituous liquor. The image is a block of
stone roughly hewn into the semblance of a human figure.<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Hills what is known as the M&acirc;tr&icirc;
P&ucirc;j&acirc; is very popular. The celebrant takes a plank and
cleans it with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>rice flour. On it he draws sixteen figures
representing the M&acirc;tr&icirc;s, and to the right of them a
representation of Ganesa. Figures of the sun and moon are also
delineated, and a brush made of sacred grass is dipped in cow-dung and
the figures touched with it. After the recital of verses, a mixture of
sugar and butter is let drop on the plank, three, five, or seven times.
The celebrant then marks the forehead of the person for whose benefit
the service is intended with a coin soaked in butter, and keeps the
money as his fee. The service concludes with a waving of lamps to scare
vicious ghosts, singing of hymns and offering of gifts to
Br&acirc;hmans.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2381src" href="#xd21e2381"

<p>At <span class="corr" id="xd21e2386" title=
"Source: Khal&acirc;ri">Khal&acirc;r&icirc;</span>, in the
R&acirc;&ecirc;pur District of the Central Provinces, is a Sat&icirc;
pillar worshipped under the name of Khal&acirc;r&icirc;
M&acirc;t&acirc;. According to the current legend Khal&acirc;r&icirc;
M&acirc;t&acirc; often assumes a female human form and goes to the
adjacent fairs, carrying vegetables for sale. Whoever asks any gift
from her receives it. Once a young man returning from a fair was
overtaken by a strange woman on the road, who said she was going to see
her sister. She asked him to go in front, and said that she would
follow. Not wishing to allow a beautiful young woman to travel alone at
night, he hid himself among some bushes. Presently he heard a great
jingling noise and saw a four-armed woman go up the steep, bare hill
and disappear. It was quite certain that this was Khal&acirc;r&icirc;
M&acirc;t&acirc; herself.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2389src" href=

<p>In many parts of the plains, M&acirc;y&acirc;, the mother of Buddha,
has been introduced into the local worship as the G&acirc;nwdev&icirc;,
or village goddess. Her statues, which are very numerous in some
places, are freely utilized for this purpose. In the same way a figure
of the Buddha Asvaghosha is worshipped at Deoriya in the
Allah&acirc;b&acirc;d District as Srinagar&icirc; Dev&icirc;.<a class=

<h3 class="main">The Jungle Mothers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As an instance of another type of Mother-worship we
may take Por&ucirc; M&acirc;&icirc; of Nadiya. She is
&ldquo;represented by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=
"#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>little piece of rough black stone
painted with red ochre, and placed beneath the boughs of an ancient
banyan tree. She is said to have been in the heart of the jungles, with
which Nadiya was originally covered, and to have suffered from the fire
which R&acirc;ja K&acirc;si N&acirc;th&rsquo;s men lighted to burn down
the jungle.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2404src" href=
"#xd21e2404" name="xd21e2404src">62</a> She is, in fact, a Mother
goddess of the jungle, of whom there are numerous instances. In the
North-Western Provinces she is usually known as Banspat&icirc; or
Bansapat&icirc; M&acirc;&icirc; (Vanaspat&icirc;, &ldquo;mistress of
the wood&rdquo;). Agni, the fire god, is described in the Rig Veda as
&ldquo;the son of the Vanaspatis,&rdquo; or the deities of the large,
old forest trees.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2407src" href="#xd21e2407"
name="xd21e2407src">63</a> Another name for her in the Western
Districts is &Acirc;saror&icirc;, because her shrine is a pile of
pebbles (<i>ror&icirc;</i>) in which her votaries have confidence
(<i>&acirc;s&acirc;</i>) that it will protect them from harm. The
shrine of the jungle mother is usually a pile of stones and branches to
which every passer-by contributes. When she is displeased she allows a
tiger or a leopard to kill her negligent votary. She is the great
goddess of the herdsmen and other dwellers in the forest, and they vow
to her a cock, a goat, or a young pig if she saves them and their
cattle from beasts of prey. Sometimes she is identified with the
Churel, more often with a Havva or Bh&ucirc;t, the spirit, usually
malignant, of some one who has met untimely death in the jungle. Akin
to her is the Ghataut of Mirzapur, who is the deity of dangerous hill
passes (<i>gh&acirc;t</i>) and is worshipped in the same way, and
Baghaut, the ghost of a man who was killed by a tiger
(<i>b&acirc;gh</i>). These all, in the villages along the edge of the
jungle, merge in character and function with the divine council, or
Deoh&acirc;r, of the local gods.</p>

<h3 class="main">Other Mother Goddesses.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another of these divine mothers, M&acirc;t&acirc;
Januv&icirc; or Janam&icirc;, the goddess of births, is a sort of Juno
Lucina among the R&acirc;jputs, like the Greek Ilithyia, or the
Carmenta of the Romans. Her power rests in a bead, and all over
Northern <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=

delivery a particular sort of bead, known as Kail&acirc;s Maura, or
&ldquo;the crown of the sacred mountain Kail&acirc;sa.&rdquo; Difficult
parturition is a disease caused by malignant spirits, and numerous are
the devices to cure it. The ancient Britons, we are told,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2430src" href="#xd21e2430" name=
"xd21e2430src">64</a> used to bind a magic girdle, impressed with
numerous mystical figures, round the waist of the expectant mother, and
the jewel named Aetites, found in the eagle&rsquo;s nest, applied to
the thigh of one in labour, eases pain and quickens delivery. Sir W.
Scott<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2433src" href="#xd21e2433" name=
"xd21e2433src">65</a> had a small stone, called a toad-stone, which
repelled demons from lying-in women.</p>
<p>On the sacred plain of Kurukshetra there once stood a fort, known as
Chakravy&ucirc;ha, and to the moderns as Chak&acirc;bu K&acirc; Qila,
from which to the present day immense ancient bricks are occasionally
dug. Popular belief ascribes great efficacy to these bricks, and in
cases of protracted labour, one of them is soaked in water, which is
given to the patient to drink. Sometimes an image of the fort, which is
in the form of a labyrinth or maze, is drawn on a dish, which is first
shown to the mother and then washed in water, which is administered to
the woman. All through Nep&acirc;l and the neighbouring districts, the
local rupee, which is covered with Saiva emblems, is used in the same
way, and Akbar&rsquo;s square rupee, known as the
Ch&acirc;ry&acirc;r&icirc;, because it bears the names of the four
companions (Ch&acirc;r-Y&acirc;r) of the Prophet, is credited with the
same power. There are numerous Mantras or mystic formul&aelig; which
are used for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Dread famine has become a goddess under the title of
Bh&ucirc;kh&icirc; M&acirc;t&acirc;, the &ldquo;hunger Mother,&rdquo;
who, like all the deities of this class, is of a lean and starved
appearance.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2440src" href="#xd21e2440" name=
"xd21e2440src">66</a> An interesting ceremony for the exorcism of the
hunger Mother is recorded from Bombay. The people subscribed to
purchase ten sheep, fifty fowls, one hundred cocoanuts, betel nuts,
sugar, clarified butter, frankincense, red powder, turmeric, and
flowers. A day previous to the commencement <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>of
the ceremony, all the inhabitants of the village, taking with them
their clothes, vessels, cattle, and other movable goods, left their
houses and encamped at the gate or boundary of the village. At the
village gate a triumphal arch was erected, and it was adorned with
garlands of flowers and mango leaves covered with red powder and
turmeric. All these things are, as we shall see, well known as scarers
of demons. The villagers bathed, put on new clothes, and then a
procession was formed. On coming to the triumphal arch the whole
procession was stopped. A hole was dug in the ground, and the village
watchman put in it the head of a sheep, a cocoanut, betel nuts, with
leaves and flowers. The arch was then worshipped by each of the
villagers. The village watchman first entered the arch, and he was
followed by the villagers with music, loud cheering, and clapping of
hands. The whole party then went to the village temple, bowed to the
village god, and went to their respective houses. The blood of the ten
sheep and fifty fowls was offered to the village god, and the flesh was
distributed among the people. A dinner was given to Br&acirc;hmans and
the rite came to an end.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2445src" href=
"#xd21e2445" name="xd21e2445src">67</a> The idea of the sanctity of the
arch is probably based on the same principle as that of perforated
stones, to which reference will be made in another connection.</p>
<p>Greatest of all the mother goddesses of the R&acirc;jputs is
M&acirc;m&acirc; Dev&icirc;, the mother of the gods. She is thus on the
same plane as Cybele Rhea and Demeter, the Corn Mother, who gives the
kindly increase of the fruits of the earth. In one of her temples she
is represented in the midst of her numerous family, including the
greater and the minor divinities. Their statues are all of the purest
marble, each about three feet high and tolerably executed, though
evidently since the decline of the art.<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We now come to consider some divinities special to the
Dr&acirc;vidian races, who touch on the North-Western Provinces
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>to the south, across the Kaim&ucirc;r and
Vindhyan ranges, the physical as well as the ethnical frontier between
the valleys of the Ganges and Jumn&acirc; and the mountain country of
Central India. The chief Gond deity is Gans&acirc;m Deo. Some vague
attempt has been made to elevate him into the pantheon of
Br&acirc;hmanism, and his name has been corrupted into
Ghanasy&acirc;ma, which means in Sanskrit, &ldquo;black like the heavy
rain clouds of the rainy season,&rdquo; and is an epithet of R&acirc;ma
and of Krishna. One legend derives him from an actual Gond chieftain,
just as many of the local godlings whom we shall consider afterwards
have sprung from real living persons of eminence, or those who have
lost their lives in some exceptional way. It is said that this
chieftain was devoured by a tiger soon after his marriage. As might
have been expected, his spirit was restless, and one year after his
death he visited his wife and she conceived by him. Instances of such
miraculous conceptions are common in folk-lore.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2460src" href="#xd21e2460" name="xd21e2460src">69</a> &ldquo;The
descendants of this ghostly embrace are, it is said, living to this day
at Amoda, in the Central Provinces. He, about the same time, appeared
to many of his old friends, and persuaded them that he could save them
from the maws of tigers and other calamities, if his worship were duly
inaugurated and regularly performed; and in consequence of this, two
festivals in the year were established in his honour; but he may be
worshipped at any time, and in all sickness and misfortunes his
votaries confidently appeal to him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In the Hill country of Mirzapur, the shrine of Gans&acirc;m is about
one hundred yards from the village site and without any ornamentation.
Both inside and outside is a platform of mud, on which the deity can
rest when so disposed. The only special offerings to him are the
curious water-pots (<i>kalsa</i>) already described, and some rude clay
figures of horses and elephants, which are regarded as the equipage
(<i>saw&acirc;r&icirc;</i>) of the deity. In the Central Provinces,
&ldquo;a bamboo with a red or yellow flag tied to the end is planted in
one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=

<p class="first">To the east of the Mirzapur District, there is a
projecting mass of rock, which, looked at from a particular place,
bears a rude resemblance to a hideous, grinning skull, with enormous
teeth. This has come to be known as D&acirc;ntan Deo or &ldquo;the
deity of the teeth,&rdquo; and is carefully propitiated by people when
they are sick or in trouble. Akin to this deity is Lalit&acirc;, who is
worshipped to the west of the Province. She is the sister of
K&acirc;l&icirc;, and brings bad dreams. Her speciality is her long
teeth, and she has sometimes a curious way of blowing up or inflating
the bodies of people who do not pay her due respect.</p>

<h3 class="main">Worship of D&ucirc;lha Deo, the Bridegroom
Godling.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another great godling of the Dr&acirc;vidian races is
D&ucirc;lha Deo, &ldquo;the bridegroom godling.&rdquo; In his worship
we have an echo of some great tragedy, which still exercises a profound
influence over the minds of the people.</p>
<p>The bridegroom on his way to fetch the bride, is, by established
Hindu custom, treated with special reverence, and this unfortunate
bridegroom, whose name is forgotten, is said to have been killed by
lightning in the midst of his marriage rejoicings, and he and his horse
were turned into stone. In fact, like Ganymede or Hylas, he was carried
off by the envy or cruel love of the merciless divine powers.</p>
<p>He is now one of the chief household deities of the Dr&acirc;vidian
people. Flowers are offered to him on the last day of Ph&acirc;lgun
(February), and at marriages a goat. Among some of the Gond tribes he
has the first place, and is identified <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>with Pharsipen, the
god of war. In the native States of R&icirc;wa and Sarguja, even
Br&acirc;hmans worship him, and his symbol or fetish is the battle-axe,
the national weapon of the Dr&acirc;vidian races, fastened to a tree.
In Mirzapur he is pre-eminently the marriage godling. In the marriage
season he is worshipped in the family cook-room, and at weddings oil
and turmeric are offered to him. When two or three children in the same
hamlet are being married at the same time, there is a great offering
made of a red goat and cakes; and to mark the benevolent character of
the deity as a household godling, the women, contrary to the usual
rule, are allowed a share of the meat. This purely domestic worship is
not done by the Baiga or devil priest, but by the Tik&acirc;it or
eldest son of the family. He is specially the tribal god of the
Ghasiyas, who pour a little spirits in the cook-room in honour of him
and of deceased relatives. The songs in his honour lay special stress
on the delicacies which the house-mother prepares for his
entertainment. Among the Kharw&acirc;rs, when the newly married pair
come home, he is worshipped near the family hearth. A goat is fed on
rice and pulse, and its head is cut off with an axe, the worshipper
folding his hands and saying, &ldquo;Take it, D&ucirc;lha
Deo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the day when this worship is performed, the ashes of the
fireplace are carefully removed with the hands, a broom is not used,
and special precautions are taken that none of the ashes fall on the
ground.</p>
<p>General Sleeman gives the legend of D&ucirc;lha Deo in another
form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In descending into the valley of the Narmad&acirc; over the
Vindhya range from Bhop&acirc;l, one may see on the side of the road,
upon a spur of the hill, a singular pillar of sandstone rising in two
spires, one turning and rising above the other to the height of some
twenty to thirty feet. On the spur of a hill, half a mile distant, is
another sandstone pillar not quite so high. The tradition is that the
smaller pillar was the affianced bride of the larger one, who was a
youth of a family of great eminence in those parts. Coming with his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>uncle to pay his first visit to his bride in the
marriage procession, he grew more and more impatient as he approached
nearer and nearer, and she shared the feeling. At last, unable to
restrain himself, he jumped from his uncle&rsquo;s shoulders, and
looked with all his might towards the place where his bride was said to
be seated. Unhappily she felt no less impatient than he did, and they
saw each other at the same moment. In that moment the bride,
bridegroom, and uncle were, all three, converted into pillars, and
there they stand to this day, a monument to warn mankind against an
inclination to indulge in curiosity. It is a singular fact that in one
of the most extensive tribes of the Gond population, to which this
couple is said to have belonged, the bride always, contrary to the
usual Hindu custom, goes to the bridegroom in procession to prevent a
recurrence of this calamity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2504src"
href="#xd21e2504" name="xd21e2504src">72</a></p>
<p>This legend is interesting from various points of view. In the first
place it is an example of a process of thought of which we shall find
instances in dealing with fetishism, whereby a legend is localized in
connection with some curious phenomenon in the scenery, which attracts
general attention. Secondly, we have an instance of the primitive taboo
which appears constantly in folk-lore, where, as in the case of
Lot&rsquo;s wife, the person who shows indiscreet curiosity by a look
is turned into stone or ashes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2509src"
href="#xd21e2509" name="xd21e2509src">73</a> Thirdly, it may represent
a survival of a custom not uncommon among primitive races, where the
marriage capturing is done, not by the bridegroom, but by the bride.
Thus, among the G&acirc;ros, all proposals of marriage must come from
the lady&rsquo;s side, and any infringement of the custom can only be
atoned for by liberal presents of beer given to her relations by the
friends of the bridegroom, who pretends to be unwilling and runs away,
but is caught and subjected to ablution, and then taken, in spite of
the resistance and counterfeited grief and lamentations of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>parents, to the bride&rsquo;s house.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2514src" href="#xd21e2514" name=
"xd21e2514src">74</a> It may then reasonably be expected that this
custom of marriage prevailed among some branches of the Gond tribe, and
that as they came more and more under Hindu influence, an unorthodox
ritual prevailing in certain clans was explained by annexing the
familiar legend of D&ucirc;lha Deo. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">We now come to consider a class of rural godlings, the
deities who control disease.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Demoniacal Theory of Disease.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is a commonplace of folk-lore and the beliefs of
all savage races that disease and death are not the result of natural
causes, but are the work of devils and demons, witchcraft, the Evil
Eye, and so forth. It is not difficult to understand the basis on which
beliefs of this class depend. There are certain varieties of disease,
such as hysteria, dementia, epilepsy, convulsions, the delirium of
fever, which in the rural mind indicate the actual working of an evil
spirit which has attacked the patient. There are, again, others, such
as cholera, which are so sudden and unexpected, so irregular in their
appearances, so capricious in the victims which they select, that they
naturally suggest the idea that they are caused by demons. Even to this
day the belief in the origin of disease from spirit possession is still
common in rural England. Fits, the falling sickness, ague, cramp,
warts, are all believed to be caused by a spirit entering the body of
the patient. Hence comes the idea that the spirit which is working the
mischief can be scared by a charm or by the exorcism of a sorcerer.
They say to the ague, &ldquo;Ague! farewell till we meet in
hell,&rdquo; and to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>cramp, &ldquo;Cramp! be thou
faultless, as Our Lady was when she bore Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is needless to say that the same theory flourishes in rural
India. Thus, in R&acirc;jput&acirc;na,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2571src" href="#xd21e2571" name="xd21e2571src">1</a> sickness is
popularly attributed to Khor, or the agency of the offended spirits of
deceased relations, and for treatment they call in a &ldquo;cunning
man,&rdquo; who propitiates the Khor by offering sweetmeats, milk, and
similar things, and gives burnt ash and black pepper sanctified by
charms to the patient. The Mahadeo Kolis of Ahmadnagar believe that
every malady or disease that seizes man, woman, child, or cattle is
caused either by an evil spirit or by an angry god. The Bijapur Vaddars
have a yearly feast to their ancestors to prevent the dead bringing
sickness into the house.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2574src" href=
"#xd21e2574" name="xd21e2574src">2</a></p>
<p>Further east in North Bhutan all diseases are supposed to be due to
possession, and the only treatment is by the use of exorcisms. Among
the G&acirc;ros, when a man sickens the priest asks which god has done
it. The Kukis and Kh&acirc;ndhs believe that all sickness is caused by
a god or by an offended ancestor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2579src"
href="#xd21e2579" name="xd21e2579src">3</a></p>
<p>So among the jungle tribes of Mirzapur, the Korwas believe that all
disease is caused by the displeasure of the Deoh&acirc;r, or the
collective village godlings. These deities sometimes become displeased
for no apparent reason, sometimes because their accustomed worship is
neglected, and sometimes through the malignity of some witch. The
special diseases which are attributed to the displeasure of these
godlings are fever, diarrh&oelig;a and cough. If small-pox comes of its
own accord in the ordinary form, it is harmless, but a more dangerous
variety is attributed to the anger of the local deities. Cholera and
fever are regarded as generally the work of some special Bh&ucirc;t or
angry ghost. The Kharw&acirc;rs believe that disease is due to the
Baiga not having paid proper attention to R&acirc;ja Chandol and the
other tutelary godlings of the village. The Pankas think that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>disease comes in various ways&mdash;sometimes
through ghosts or witches, sometimes because the godlings and deceased
ancestors were not suitably propitiated. All these people believe that
in the blazing days of the Indian summer the goddess Dev&icirc; flies
through the air and strikes any child which wears a red garment. The
result is the symptoms which less imaginative people call sunstroke.
Instances of similar beliefs drawn from the superstitions of the lower
races all over the country might be almost indefinitely extended. Even
in our own prayers for the sick we pray the Father &ldquo;to renew
whatsoever has been decayed by the fraud and malice of the Devil, or by
the carnal will and frailness&rdquo; of the patient.</p>
<p>Leprosy is a disease which is specially regarded as a punishment for
sin, and a Hindu affected by this disease remains an outcast until he
can afford to undertake a purificatory ceremony. Even lesser ailments
are often attributed to the wrath of some offended god or saint. Thus,
in Sat&acirc;ra, the King Sateswar asked the saint Sumitra for water.
The sage was wrapped in contemplation, and did not answer him. So the
angry monarch took some lice from the ground and threw them at the
saint, who cursed the King with vermin all over his body. He endured
the affliction for twelve years, until he was cured by ablution at the
sacred fountain of Devr&acirc;shta.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2588src"
href="#xd21e2588" name="xd21e2588src">4</a> As we shall see, the
Beng&acirc;lis have a special deity who rules the itch.</p>
<p>From ideas of this kind the next stage is the actual impersonation
of the deity who brings disease, and hence the troop of disease
godlings which are worshipped all over India, and to whose propitiation
much of the thoughts of the peasant are devoted.</p>

<h3 class="main">S&icirc;tal&acirc;, the Goddess of Small-pox.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of these deities the most familiar is
S&icirc;tal&acirc;, &ldquo;she that loves the cool,&rdquo; so called
euphemistically in consequence of the fever which accompanies
small-pox, the chief infant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href=
"#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>plague of India, which is under
her control. S&icirc;tal&acirc; has other euphemistic names. She is
called M&acirc;t&acirc;, &ldquo;the Mother&rdquo; <i>par
excellence</i>; Jag R&acirc;n&icirc;, &ldquo;the queen of the
world;&rdquo; Phapholew&acirc;l&icirc;, &ldquo;she of the
vesicle;&rdquo; Kalejew&acirc;l&icirc;, &ldquo;she who attacks the
liver,&rdquo; which is to the rustic the seat of all disease. Some call
her Mah&acirc; M&acirc;&icirc;, &ldquo;the great Mother.&rdquo; These
euphemistic titles for the deities of terror are common to all the
mythologies. The Greeks of old called the awful Erinyes, the Eumenides,
&ldquo;the well-meaning.&rdquo; So the modern Greeks picture the
small-pox as a woman, the enemy of children, and call her Sunchoremene,
&ldquo;indulgent,&rdquo; or &ldquo;exorable,&rdquo; and Eulogia,
&ldquo;one to be praised or blessed;&rdquo; and the Celts call the
fairies &ldquo;the men of peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;the good
people,&rdquo; or &ldquo;good neighbours.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2603src" href="#xd21e2603" name="xd21e2603src">5</a></p>
<p>In her original form as a village goddess she has seldom a special
priest or a regular temple. A few fetish stones, tended by some
low-class menial, constitute her shrine. As she comes to be promoted
into some form of K&acirc;l&icirc; or Dev&icirc;, she is provided with
an orthodox shrine. She receives little or no respect from men, but
women and children attend her service in large numbers on
&ldquo;S&icirc;tal&acirc;&rsquo;s seventh,&rdquo; S&icirc;tal&acirc;
K&icirc; Saptam&icirc;, which is her feast day. In Bengal she is
worshipped on a piece of ground marked out and smeared with cow-dung. A
fire being lighted, and butter and spirits thrown upon it, the
worshipper makes obeisance, bowing his forehead to the ground and
muttering incantations. A hog is then sacrificed, and the bones and
offal being burnt, the flesh is roasted and eaten, but no one must take
home with him any scrap of the victim.<a class="noteref" id=

GODLINGS.</p>
</div>
<p>Two special shrines of S&icirc;tal&acirc; in Upper India may be
specially referred to. That at Kankhal near Hardw&acirc;r has a curious
legend, which admirably illustrates the catholicity of Hinduism. Here
the local S&icirc;tal&acirc; has the special title of Turkin, or
&ldquo;the Muhammadan lady.&rdquo; There was once a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>princess born to one of the Mughal Emperors,
who, according to the traditions of the dynasty, when many of the chief
ladies of the harem were of Hindu birth, had a warm sympathy for her
ancestral faith. So she made a pilgrimage to Hardw&acirc;r, and thence
set off to visit the holy shrines situated in the upper course of the
Ganges. When she reached the holy land of Badarin&acirc;th, the god
himself appeared to her in a dream, and warned her that she being a
Musalm&acirc;n, her intrusion into his domains would probably encourage
the attacks of the infidel. So he ordered her to return and take up her
abode in Kankhal, where as a reward for her piety she should after her
death become the guardian goddess of children and be deified as a
manifestation of S&icirc;tal&acirc;. So after her death a temple was
erected on the site of her tomb, and she receives the homage of
multitudes of pilgrims. There is another noted shrine of
S&icirc;tal&acirc; at R&acirc;&ecirc;wala, in the Dehra D&ucirc;n
District. She is a Sat&icirc;, G&acirc;ndhar&icirc;, the wife of
Dhritar&acirc;shtra, the mother of Duryodhana. When
Dhritar&acirc;shtra, through the force of his divine absorption, was
consumed with fire at Sapta-srota, near Hardw&acirc;r, <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2620" title=
"Source: G&acirc;ndh&acirc;ri">G&acirc;ndhar&icirc;</span> also jumped
into the fire and became Sat&icirc; with her husband. Then, in
recognition of her piety, the gods blessed her with the boon that in
the Iron Age she should become the guardian deity of children and the
goddess of small-pox in particular. Another noted S&icirc;tal&acirc; in
this part of the country is the deity known as Ujal&icirc;
M&acirc;t&acirc;, or &ldquo;the White Mother,&rdquo; who has a shrine
in the Muzaffarnagar District. Here vast crowds assemble, and women
make vows at her temple for the boon of sons, and when a child is born
they take it there and perform their vow by making the necessary
offering to the goddess. One peculiarity of the worship of the Kankhal
goddess and of Ujal&icirc; M&acirc;t&acirc; is that calves are released
at her shrine. This can hardly be anything else but a survival of the
rite of cattle slaughter, and this is one of many indications that the
worship of S&icirc;tal&acirc; is a most primitive cult, and probably of
indigenous origin.</p>
<p>S&icirc;tal&acirc;, according to one story, is only the eldest of a
band <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>of seven sisters, by whom the pustular group of
diseases is supposed to be caused. So the charmer Lilith has twelve
daughters, who are the twelve kinds of fevers, and this arrangement of
diseases or evil spirits in categories of sevens or twelves is found in
the Chaldaic magic.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2627src" href=
"#xd21e2627" name="xd21e2627src">7</a> Similarly in the older Indian
mythology we have the seven M&acirc;tr&icirc;s, the seven oceans, the
seven Rishis, the seven Adityas and D&acirc;navas, and the seven horses
of the sun, and numerous other combinations of this mystic number. One
list gives their names as S&icirc;tal&acirc;, Mas&acirc;n&icirc;,
Basanti, Mah&acirc; M&acirc;&icirc;, Polamd&ecirc;, Lamkariy&acirc;,
and Agw&acirc;n&icirc;.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2630src" href=
"#xd21e2630" name="xd21e2630src">8</a> We shall meet Mas&acirc;n&icirc;
or Mas&acirc;n, the deity of the cremation ground, in another
connection. Basant&icirc; is the &ldquo;yellow goddess,&rdquo; so
called probably on account of the colour of the skin in these diseases.
Mah&acirc; M&acirc;&icirc; is merely &ldquo;the great Mother.&rdquo;
Polamd&ecirc; is possibly &ldquo;she who makes the body soft or
flabby,&rdquo; and Lamkariy&acirc;, &ldquo;she that hasteneth.&rdquo;
Agw&acirc;n&icirc; is <span class="corr" id="xd21e2633" title=
"Source: sa&icirc;d">said</span> to mean &ldquo;the leader,&rdquo; and
by one account, Agw&acirc;n, who has twenty-five thousand votaries,
according to the last census returns, in the North-West Provinces, is
the son of R&acirc;ja Ben, or Vena, and the brother of the small-pox
sisters. At Hardw&acirc;r they give the names of the seven sisters as
S&icirc;tal&acirc;, Sedal&acirc;, Runuk&icirc;, Jhunuk&icirc;,
Mihil&acirc;, Merhal&acirc;, and Mandil&acirc;, a set of names which
smacks of some modification of an aboriginal cultus.</p>
<p>Their shrines cluster round the special shrine of
S&icirc;tal&acirc;, and the villagers to the west of the North-West
Provinces call them her Khidmatg&acirc;rs, or body servants. Round many
of the shrines again, as at Kankhal, we find a group of minor shrines,
which by one explanation are called the shrines of the other disease
godlings. Villagers say that when disease appears in a family, the
housewife comes and makes a vow, and if the patient recovers she makes
a little shrine to the peculiar form of Dev&icirc; which she considers
responsible for the illness. The Br&acirc;hmans say that these minor
shrines are in honour of the Yogin&icirc;s, who are usually
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>said to number eight&mdash;M&acirc;rjan&icirc;,
Karp&ucirc;ratilak&acirc;, Malayagandhin&icirc; Kauamudik&acirc;,
Bherund&acirc;, M&acirc;t&acirc;l&icirc;, N&acirc;yak&icirc;,
Jay&acirc; or Subh&acirc;ch&acirc;r&acirc;, Sulakshan&acirc; and
Sunand&acirc;. In the <span class="corr" id="xd21e2640" title=
"Source: Gurgaon">Gurg&acirc;on</span> District, accompanying images of
S&icirc;tal&acirc;, is one of Sedhu L&acirc;la, who is inferior to her,
yet often worshipped before her, because he is regarded as her servant
and intercessor. Copper coins are thrown behind her shrine into a
saucer, which is known as her M&acirc;lkh&acirc;na or Treasury. Rice
and other articles of food are placed in front of her shrine, and
afterwards distributed to Cham&acirc;rs, the currier caste, and to
dogs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2643src" href="#xd21e2643" name=
"xd21e2643src">9</a></p>
<p>Like so many deities of this class S&icirc;tal&acirc; is on the way
to promotion to the higher heaven. In some places she is identified
with K&acirc;lik&acirc; Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;, and one list of the seven
small-pox sisters gives their names as S&icirc;tal&acirc;,
Ph&ucirc;lmat&icirc;, Chamariy&acirc;, Durg&acirc; K&acirc;l&icirc;,
Mah&acirc; K&acirc;l&icirc;, and Bhadr&acirc; K&acirc;l&icirc;. This
has obviously passed through the mill of Br&acirc;hmanism. Of these,
Chamariy&acirc; is doubtless allied to Ch&acirc;mar, who is a vaguely
described low-caste deity, worshipped in the North-Western Provinces.
Some say he is the ghost of a Cham&acirc;r, or worker in leather, who
died an untimely death. Chamariy&acirc; is said to be the eldest and
Ph&ucirc;lmat&icirc; the youngest sister of S&icirc;tal&acirc;. She, by
the common account, takes her name from the pustules
(<i>ph&ucirc;l</i>) of the disease. She brings the malady in its
mildest form, and the worst variety is the work of S&icirc;tal&acirc;
in person. She lives in the N&icirc;m tree, and hence a patient
suffering from the disease is fanned with its leaves. A very bad form
of confluent small-pox is the work of Chamariy&acirc;, who must be
propitiated with the offering of a pig through a Cham&acirc;r or other
low-caste priest. The influence of K&acirc;l&icirc; in her threefold
form is chiefly felt in connection with other pustular diseases besides
small-pox. Earthenware images of elephants are placed at her shrine,
and her offerings consist of cakes, sweetmeats, pigs, goats, sheep, and
black fowls. Bhadr&acirc; K&acirc;l&icirc; is the least formidable of
all. The only person who has influence over K&acirc;l&icirc; is the
Ojha, or sorcerer, who, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>cholera and similar epidemics
prevail, collects a subscription and performs a regular expiatory
service.</p>

<h3 class="main">Connection of S&icirc;tal&acirc; with Human
Sacrifice.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In her form as household goddess, S&icirc;tal&acirc;
is often known as Thand&icirc;, or &ldquo;the cool one,&rdquo; and her
habitation is in the house behind the water-pots, in the cold, damp
place where the water drips. Here she is worshipped by the
house-mother, but only cold food or cold water is offered to her.</p>
<p>There is, however, a darker side to the worship of
S&icirc;tal&acirc; and the other disease godlings than this mild
household service. In 1817 a terrible epidemic of cholera broke out at
Jessore. &ldquo;The disease commenced its ravages in August, and it was
at once discovered that the August of this year had five Saturdays (a
day under the influence of the ill-omened Sani). The number five being
the express property of the destructive Siva, a mystical connection was
at once detected, the infallibly baneful influence of which it would
have been sacrilege to question. On the night of the 27th a strange
commotion spread through the villages adjacent to the station. A number
of magicians were reported to have quitted Marelli with a human head in
their possession, which they were to be directed by the presence of
supernatural signs to leave in a certain, and to them unknown, village.
The people on all sides were ready by force to arrest the progress of
these nocturnal visitors. For the prophecy foretold that wherever the
head fell, the destroying angel terminating her sanguinary course would
rest, and the demon of death, thus satisfied, would refrain from
further devastation in that part of the country. Dr. Tytler says that
on that night, while walking along the road, endeavouring to allay the
agitation, the judge and he perceived a faint light arising from a
thick clump of bamboos. Attracted to the spot, they found a hut which
was illuminated, and contained images of five Hindu gods, one of which
was S&icirc;tal&acirc;, the celebrated and formidable Aul&acirc;
B&icirc;b&icirc;, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"
name="pb131">131</a>]</span>&lsquo;Our Lady of the Flux,&rsquo; an
incarnation of K&acirc;l&icirc;, who it is believed is one day to
appear riding on a horse for the purpose of slaughtering mankind, and
of setting the world on fire. In front of the idol a female child about
nine years of age lay on the ground. She was evidently stupefied with
intoxicating drugs, and in this way prepared to answer responses to
such questions as those initiated into the mysteries should think
proper to propose.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2662src" href=
"#xd21e2662" name="xd21e2662src">10</a> There is much in this statement
which is open to question, and it seems doubtful whether, as Dr.
Chevers is disposed to believe, the case was really one of intended
human sacrifice.</p>

<h3 class="main">Small-pox Worship in Bengal.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Bengal the divine force antagonistic to
S&icirc;tal&acirc; is Shashth&icirc;, &ldquo;goddess of the
sixth,&rdquo; who is regarded as the special guardian of children. The
worship of Shashth&icirc; rests on a physiological fact, which has only
recently been applied to explain this special form of worship. The most
fatal disease of Indian children is a form of infantile lock-jaw, which
is caused by the use of a coarse, blunt instrument, such as a sickle,
for severing the umbilical cord. This disease usually makes its
appearance between the sixth and twelfth day of the life of the child,
and hence we have the formal rites of purification from the birth
pollution performed as the Chhath&icirc; on the sixth and the
Barah&icirc; on the twelfth day after delivery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Bengal when small-pox rages, the gardeners are busiest. As
soon as the nature of the disease is determined, the physician retires
and a gardener is summoned. His first act is to forbid the introduction
of meat, fish, and all food requiring oil or spices for its
preparation. He then ties a lock of hair, a cowry shell, a piece of
turmeric, and an article of gold on the right wrist of the patient.
(The use of these articles as scarers of evil spirits will be
considered later on.) The sick person is then laid on the Majhpatta,
the young and unexpanded leaf of the plantain tree, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>milk
is prescribed as the sole article of food. He is fanned with a branch
of the sacred N&icirc;m (<i>Azidirachta Indica</i>), and any one
entering the chamber is sprinkled with water. Should the fever become
aggravated and delirium ensue, or if the child cries much and sleeps
little, the gardener performs the M&acirc;t&acirc; P&ucirc;j&acirc;.
This consists in bathing an image of the goddess causing the disease,
and giving a draught of the water to drink. To relieve the irritation
of the skin, pease meal, turmeric, flour or shell sawdust is sprinkled
over the body. If the eruption be copious, a piece of new cloth in the
figure of eight is wrapped round the chest and shoulders. On the night
between the seventh and eighth days of the eruption, the gardener has
much to do. He places a water-pot in the sick-room, and puts on it
rice, a cocoanut, sugar, plantains, a yellow rag, flowers, and a few
N&icirc;m leaves. Having mumbled several spells (<i>mantra</i>), he
recites the tale (<i>qissa</i>) of the particular goddess, which often
occupies several hours. When the pustules are mature, the gardener dips
a thorn of the Karaunda (<i>Carissa</i>) in sesamum oil and punctures
each one. The body is then anointed with oil, and cooling fruits are
given. When the scabs have peeled off, another ceremony called
God&acirc;m is gone through. All the offerings on the water-pot are
rolled in a cloth and fastened round the waist of the patient. The
offerings are the perquisite of the gardener, who also receives a fee.
Government vaccinators earn a considerable sum yearly by executing the
S&icirc;tal&acirc; worship, and when a child is vaccinated, a portion
of the service is performed&rdquo;&mdash;a curious compromise between
the indigenous faith and European medical science.<a class="noteref"

<p>The special Tirh&ucirc;t observance of the Jur S&icirc;tal or
&ldquo;smallpox fever&rdquo; feast will be more conveniently considered
in connection with other usages of the same kind.</p>

<p class="first">We have already seen that S&icirc;tal&acirc; is in the
stage of promotion to the Br&acirc;hmanical heaven. Here her special
name <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>is M&acirc;tang&icirc; Sakt&icirc;, a word which
has been connected with M&acirc;t&acirc; and Mas&acirc;n, but really
refers to Durg&acirc;-Dev&icirc; in her terrible elephant form.
Mas&acirc;n or Mas&acirc;n&icirc; is quite a different goddess. She
resides at the Mas&acirc;n or cremation ground, and is greatly dreaded.
The same name is in the eastern district of the North-Western Provinces
applied to the tomb of some low-caste man, very often a Teli or oilman,
or a Dhobi or washerman, both of whose ghosts are generally obnoxious.
Envious women will take the ashes from a cremation ground and throw
them over an enemy&rsquo;s child. This is said to cause them to be
&ldquo;under the influence of the shadow&rdquo; (S&acirc;ya,
Chh&acirc;ya) and to waste away by slow decline. This idea is familiar
in folk-lore. All savages believe that their shadow is a part of
themselves, that if it be hurt the owner of it will feel pain, that a
man may lose his shadow altogether and thus be deprived of part of his
soul and strength, and that vicious people, as in the present case, can
fling their shadow upon you and cause you injury.<a class="noteref" id=

Dev&icirc;, Durg&acirc; Dev&icirc; and Sankar&acirc; Dev&icirc;, a
collection of names which indicates the extraordinary mixture of
beliefs, some of them importations from the regular mythology, but
others obscure and local manifestations of the deity, out of which this
worship has been developed. She is described as having ears as large as
a winnowing fan, projecting teeth, a hideous face with a wide open
mouth. Her vehicle is the ass, an animal very often found in
association with shrines of S&icirc;tal&acirc;. She carries a broom and
winnowing fan with which she sifts mankind, and in one hand a pitcher
and ewer. This fan and broom are, as we shall see later on, most
powerful fetishes. All this is sheer mythology at its lowest stage, and
represents the grouping of various local fetish beliefs on the original
household worship. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134"

Small-pox.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During a small-pox epidemic no journey, not even a
pilgrimage to a holy shrine, should be undertaken. Gen.
Sleeman<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2711src" href="#xd21e2711" name=
"xd21e2711src">13</a> gives a curious case in illustration of this:
&ldquo;At this time the only son of R&acirc;ma Krishna&rsquo;s brother,
Khushh&acirc;l Chand, an interesting boy of about four years of age,
was extremely ill of small-pox. His father was told that he had better
defer his journey to Benares till the child should recover; but he
could neither eat nor sleep, so great was his terror lest some dreadful
calamity should befall the whole family before he could expiate a
sacrilege which he had committed unwittingly, or take the advice of his
high priest, as to the best manner of doing so, and he resolved to
leave the decision to God himself. He took two pieces of paper and
having caused <i>Benares</i> to be written on one and <i>Jabalpur</i>
on the other, he put them both in a brass vessel. After shaking the
vessel well, he drew forth that on which Benares had been written.
&lsquo;It is the will of God,&rsquo; said R&acirc;ma Krishna. All the
family who were interested in the preservation of the poor boy implored
him not to set out, lest the Dev&icirc; who presides over small-pox
should be angry. It was all in vain. He would set out with his
household god, and unable to carry it himself, he put it upon a small
litter upon a pole, and hired a bearer to carry it at one end while he
supported the other. His brother Khushh&acirc;l Chand sent his second
wife at the same time with offerings to the Dev&icirc;, to ward off the
effects of his brother&rsquo;s rashness from the child. By the time his
brother had got with his god to Adhart&acirc;l, three miles from
Jabalpur, he heard of the death of his nephew. But he seemed not to
feel this slight blow in the terror of the dreadful, but undefined,
calamity which he felt to be impending over him and the whole family,
and he went on his road. Soon after, an infant son of his uncle died of
the same disease, and the whole town at once became divided into two
parties&mdash;those who held that the child had been killed by the
Dev&icirc; as a punishment for R&acirc;ma Krishna&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>presuming to leave Jabalpur before they
recovered, and those who held that they were killed by the god Vishnu
himself for having deprived him of one of his arms. Khushh&acirc;l
Chand&rsquo;s wife sickened on the road and died before reaching
Mirzapur; and as the Dev&icirc; was supposed to have nothing to say to
fevers, this event greatly augmented the advocates of
Vishnu.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Observances during Small-pox Epidemics.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Panj&acirc;b when a child falls ill of
small-pox no one is allowed to enter the house, especially if he have
bathed, washed, or combed his hair, and if any one does come in, he is
made to burn incense at the door. Should a thunderstorm come on before
the vesicles have fully come out, the sound is not allowed to enter the
ear of the sick child, and metal plates are violently beaten to drown
the noise of the thunder. For six or seven days, when the disease is at
its height, the child is fed with raisins covered with silver leaf.
When the vesicles have fully developed it is believed that Dev&icirc;
M&acirc;t&acirc; has come. When the disease has abated a little, water
is thrown over the child. Singers and drummers are summoned and the
parents make with their friends a procession to the temple of
Dev&icirc;, carrying the child dressed in saffron-coloured clothes. A
man goes in advance with a bunch of sacred grass in his hands, from
which he sprinkles a mixture of milk and water. In this way they visit
some fig-tree or other shrine of Dev&icirc;, to which they tie red
ribbons and besmear it with red lead, paint and curds.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2727src" href="#xd21e2727" name=
"xd21e2727src">14</a></p>
<p>One method of protecting children from the disease is to give them
opprobrious names, and dress them in rags. This, with other devices for
disease transference, will be discussed later on. We have seen that the
N&icirc;m tree is supposed to influence the disease; hence branches of
it are hung over the door of the sick-room. Thunder disturbs the
goddess in possession of the child, so the family flour-mill, which, as
as we shall see, has mystic powers, is rattled near the child.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>Another device is to feed a donkey, which is the
animal on which S&icirc;tal&acirc; rides. This is specially known in
the Panj&acirc;b as the Jand&icirc; P&ucirc;j&acirc;.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2737src" href="#xd21e2737" name="xd21e2737src">15</a> In the
same belief that the patient is under the direct influence of the
goddess, if death ensues the purification of the corpse by cremation is
considered both unnecessary and improper. Like Gus&acirc;&icirc;ns,
Jogis, and similar persons who are regarded as inspired, those who die
of this disease are buried, not cremated. As Sir A. C. Lyall
observes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2740src" href="#xd21e2740" name=
"xd21e2740src">16</a> &ldquo;The rule is ordinarily expounded by the
priests to be imperative, because the outward signs and symptoms mark
the actual presence of divinity; the small-pox is not the god&rsquo;s
work, but the god himself manifest; but there is also some ground for
concluding that the process of burying has been found more wholesome
than the hurried and ill-managed cremation, which prevails during a
fatal epidemic.&rdquo; Gen. Sleeman gives an instance of an outbreak of
the disease which was attributed to a violation of this traditional
rule.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2743src" href="#xd21e2743" name=

<h3 class="main">Minor Disease Godlings.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are a number of minor disease godlings, some of
whom may be mentioned here. The Benares godling of malaria is
Jvarahar&icirc;svara, &ldquo;the god who repels the fever.&rdquo; The
special offering to him is what is called Dudhbhanga, a confection made
of milk, the leaves of the hemp plant and sweetmeats. Among the Kols of
Chaib&acirc;sa, Bangara is the godling of fever and is associated with
Gohem, Chondu, Negra and Dichali, who are considered respectively the
godlings of cholera, the itch, indigestion and death. The
Beng&acirc;lis have a special service for the worship of Ghentu, the
itch godling. The scene of the service is a dunghill. A broken
earthenware pot, its bottom blackened with constant use for cooking,
daubed white with lime, interspersed with a few streaks of turmeric,
together with a branch or two of the Ghentu plant, and last, not least,
a broomstick of the genuine palmyra or cocoanut stock, serve
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>as the representation of the presiding deity of
itch. The mistress of the family, for whose benefit the worship is
done, acts as priestess. After a few doggrel lines are recited, the pot
is broken and the pieces collected by the children, who sing songs
about the itch godling.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2754src" href=
"#xd21e2754" name="xd21e2754src">18</a></p>
<p>Some of these godlings are, like Shashth&icirc;, protectors of
children from infantile disorders. Such are in Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d
Bijaysen, in whose name a string, which, as we shall see, exercises a
powerful influence over demons, is hung round the necks of children
from birth till marriage, and Kurdeo, whose name represents the
Kuladevat&acirc;, or family deity. Among the Kurkus he presides over
the growth and health of the children in three or four villages
together.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2759src" href="#xd21e2759" name=
"xd21e2759src">19</a> Acheri, a disease sprite in the Hills,
particularly favours those who wear red garments, and in his name a
scarlet thread is tied round the throat as an amulet against cold, and
goitre. Ghanta Karana, &ldquo;he who has ears as broad as a
bell,&rdquo; or &ldquo;who wears bells in his ears,&rdquo; is another
disease godling of the Hills. He is supposed to be of great personal
attractions, and is worshipped under the form of a water jar as the
healer of cutaneous diseases. He is a gate-keeper, or, in other words,
a godling on his promotion, in many of the Garhw&acirc;l
temples.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2762src" href="#xd21e2762" name=
"xd21e2762src">20</a></p>
<p>Among the Kurkus of Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d, Mutua Deo is
represented by a heap of stones inside the village. His special
sacrifice is a pig, and his particular mission is to send epidemics,
and particularly fevers, in which case he must be propitiated with
extraordinary sacrifices.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2767src" href=
"#xd21e2767" name="xd21e2767src">21</a></p>
<p>One of the great disease Mothers is Mar&icirc; Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;.
She has her speciality in the regulation of cholera, which she spreads
or withholds according to the attention she receives. They tell a
curious story about her in Oudh. Safdar Jang, having established his
virtual independence of the Mughal Empire, determined to build a
capital. He selected as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href=
"#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>site for it the high bank of the
G&ucirc;mti, overlooking P&acirc;pargh&acirc;t in Sult&acirc;npur. And
but for the accident of a sickly season, that now comparatively unknown
locality might have enjoyed the celebrity which afterwards fell to the
lot of Faiz&acirc;b&acirc;d. The fort was already begun when the news
reached the Emperor, who sent his minister a khilat, to all outward
appearance suited to his rank and dignity. The royal gift had been
packed up with becoming care, and its arrival does not seem to have
struck Safdar Jang as incompatible with the rebellious attitude which
he had assumed. The box in which it was enclosed was opened with due
ceremony, when it was discovered that the Emperor, with grim
pleasantry, had selected as an appropriate gift an image of Mar&icirc;
Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;. The mortality which ensued in Safdar Jang&rsquo;s
army was appalling, and the site was abandoned, Mar&icirc;
Bhav&acirc;n&icirc; being left in sole possession. Periodical fairs are
now held there in her honour.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2774src" href=

<h3 class="main">Hardaul L&acirc;la, the Cholera Godling.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But the great cholera godling of Northern India is
Hardaul, Hardaur, Harda, Hardiya or Hardiha L&acirc;la. It is only
north of the Jumn&acirc; that he appears to control the plague, and in
Bundelkhand, his native home, he seems to have little connection with
it. With him we reach a class of godlings quite distinct from nearly
all those whom we have been considering. He is one of that numerous
class who were in their lifetime actual historical personages, and who
from some special cause, in his case from the tragic circumstances of
his death, have been elevated to a seat among the hosts of heaven.
Hardaur L&acirc;la, or D&icirc;v&acirc;n Hardaur, was the second son of
B&icirc;r Sinha Deva, the miscreant R&acirc;ja of Orchha, in
Bundelkhand, who, at the instigation of Prince Jah&acirc;ng&icirc;r,
assassinated the accomplished Abul Fazl, the litterateur of the court
of Akbar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2782src" href="#xd21e2782" name=
"xd21e2782src">23</a> His brother Jhajh&acirc;r, or Jhujh&acirc;r, Sinh
succeeded to the throne <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=
"#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>on the death of his father; and
after some time suspecting Hardaur of undue intimacy with his wife, he
compelled her to poison her lover with all his companions at a feast in
1627 <span class="sc">A.D.</span></p>
<p>After this tragedy it happened that the daughter of the Princess
Kanj&acirc;vat&icirc;, sister of Jhajh&acirc;r and Hardaur, was about
to be married. Her mother, according to the ordinary rule of family
etiquette, sent an invitation to Jhajh&acirc;r Sinh to attend the
wedding. He refused with the mocking taunt that she would be wise to
invite her favourite brother Hardaur. Thereupon, she in despair went to
his cenotaph and lamented his wretched end. Hardaur from below answered
her cries, and promised to attend the wedding and make all the
necessary arrangements. The ghost kept his promise, and arranged the
marriage ceremony as befitted the honour of his house.</p>
<p>Subsequently he is said to have visited the bedside of the Emperor
Akbar at midnight, and besought him to issue an order that platforms
should be erected in his name, and honour be paid to him in every
village of the Empire, promising that if he were duly propitiated, no
wedding should ever be marred with storm or rain, and that no one who
before eating presented a share of his meal to him, should ever want
for bread. Akbar, it is said, complied with these requests, and since
then the ghost of Hardaul has been worshipped in nearly every village
in Northern India. But here, as in many of these legends, the
chronology is hopeless. Akbar died in 1605 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span>, and the murder of Hardaul is fixed in 1627.</p>
<p>He is chiefly honoured at weddings, and in the month of
Bais&acirc;kh (May), when the women, particularly those of the lower
classes, visit his shrine and eat the offerings presented to him. The
shrine is always erected outside the hamlet, and is decorated with
flags. On the day but one before the arrival of a wedding procession,
the women of the family worship Hardaul, and invite him to the
ceremony. If any signs of a storm appear, he is propitiated with songs,
one of the best known of which runs thus&mdash; <span class=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">L&acirc;la! Thy shrine is in every hamlet!</p>
<p class="line">Thy name throughout the land!</p>

<p class="first">Many of these shrines have a stone figure of the hero
represented on horseback, set up at the head or west side of the
platform. From his birthplace Hardaul is also known as Bundela, and one
of the quarters in Mirzapur, and in the town of Brindaban in the
Mathura District, is named after him.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2828src" href="#xd21e2828" name="xd21e2828src">24</a></p>
<p>But while in his native land of Bundelkhand Hardaul is a wedding
godling, in about the same rank as Dulha Deo among the Dr&acirc;vidian
tribes, to the north of the Jumn&acirc; it is on his power of
influencing epidemics of cholera that his reputation mainly rests. The
terrible outbreak of this pestilence, which occurred in the camp of the
Governor-General, the Marquess Hastings, during the Pind&acirc;ri war,
was generally attributed by the people to the killing of beef for the
use of the British troops in the grove where the ashes of Hardaul
repose. Sir C. A. Elliott remarks that he has seen statements in the
old official correspondence of 1828 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, when
we first took possession of Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d, that the district
officers were directed to force the village headmen to set up altars to
Hardaul L&acirc;la in every village. This was part of the system of
&ldquo;preserving the cultivators,&rdquo; since it was found that they
ran away, if their fears of epidemics were not calmed by the respect
paid to the local gods. But in Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d, the worship of
Hardaul L&acirc;la has fallen into great neglect in recent times, the
repeated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>recurrence of cholera having shaken the belief
in the potency of his influence over the disease.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Exorcism of the Cholera Demon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mention has been already made of the common belief in
an actual embodiment of pestilence in a human or ghostly form. A
disease so sudden and mysterious as cholera is naturally capable of a
superstitious explanation of this kind. Everywhere it is believed to be
due to the agency of a demon, which can be expelled by noise and
special incantations, or removed by means of a scapegoat. Thus, the
Muhammadans of Herat believed that a spirit of cholera stalked through
the land in advance of the actual disease.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2846src" href="#xd21e2846" name="xd21e2846src">26</a> All over
Upper India, when cholera prevails, you may see fires lighted on the
boundaries of villages to bar the approach of the demon of the plague,
and the people shouting and beating drums to hasten his departure. On
one occasion I was present at such a ceremonial while out for an
evening drive, and as we approached the place the grooms advised us to
stop the horses in order to allow the demon to cross the road ahead of
us without interruption.</p>
<p>This expulsion of the disease spirit is often a cause of quarrels
and riots, as villages who are still safe from the epidemic strongly
resent the introduction of the demon within their boundaries. In a
recent case at Allah&acirc;b&acirc;d a man stated that the cholera
monster used to attempt to enter his house nightly, that his head
resembled a large earthen pot, and that he and his brother were obliged
to bar his entrance with their clubs. Another attributed the immunity
of his family to the fact that he possessed a gun, which he regularly
fired at night to scare the demon. Not long ago some men in the same
district enticed the cholera demon into an earthen pot by magical
rites, and clapping on the lid, formed a procession in the dead of
night for the purpose of carrying the pot to a neighbouring village,
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>which their relations were the reverse of
cordial, and burying it there secretly. But the enemy were on the
watch, and turned out in force to frustrate this fell intent. A serious
riot occurred, in the course of which the receptacle containing the
evil spirit was unfortunately broken and he escaped to continue his
ravages in the neighbourhood.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2853src" href=
"#xd21e2853" name="xd21e2853src">27</a> In Bombay, when cholera breaks
out in a village, the village potter is asked to make an image of the
goddess of cholera. When the image is ready, the village people go in
procession to the potter&rsquo;s house, and tell him to carry the image
to a spot outside the village. When it is taken to the selected place,
it is first worshipped by the potter and then by the
villagers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2856src" href="#xd21e2856" name=
"xd21e2856src">28</a> Here, as in many instances of similar rites, the
priest is a man of low caste, which points to the indigenous character
of the worship.</p>
<p>In the western districts of the North-Western Provinces the rite
takes a more advanced form. When cholera prevails, K&acirc;l&icirc;
Dev&icirc; is worshipped, and a magic circle of milk and spirits is
drawn round the village, over which the cholera demon does not care to
step. They have also a reading of the Scriptures in honour of
Durg&acirc;, and worship a Sat&icirc; shrine, if there be one in the
village. The next stage is the actual scapegoat, which is, as we shall
see, very generally used for this purpose. A buffalo bull is marked
with a red pigment and driven to the next village, where he carries the
plague with him. Quite recently, at Meerut, the people purchased a
buffalo, painted it red and led the animal through the city in
procession. Colonel Tod describes how Z&acirc;lim Sinh, the celebrated
regent of Kota, drove cholera out of the place. &ldquo;Having assembled
the Br&acirc;hmans, astrologers and those versed in incantations, a
grand rite was got up, sacrifices made, and a solemn decree of
banishment was pronounced against Mar&icirc;, the cholera goddess.
Accordingly an equipage was prepared for her, decorated with funeral
emblems, painted black and drawn by a double team of black oxen; bags
of grain, also black, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>were put into the vehicle, that
the lady might not go without food, and driven by a man in sable
vestments, followed by the yells of the populace, Mar&icirc; was
deported across the Chambal river, with the commands of the priests
that she should never again set foot in Kota. No sooner did my deceased
friend hear of her expulsion from that capital, and being placed on the
road for B&ucirc;ndi, than the wise men of the city were called on to
provide means to keep her from entering therein. Accordingly, all the
water of the Ganges at hand was in requisition; an earthen vessel was
placed over the southern portal from which the sacred water was
continually dripping, and against which no evil could prevail. Whether
my friend&rsquo;s supply of the holy water failed, or Mar&icirc;
disregarded such opposition, she reached the palace.&rdquo;<a class=

<h3 class="main">Cholera caused by Witchcraft.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Gujar&acirc;t, among the wilder tribes, the belief
prevails that cholera is caused by old women who feed on the corpses of
the victims of the pestilence. Formerly, when a case occurred their
practice was to go to the soothsayer (Bhagat), find out from him who
was the guilty witch, and kill her with much torture. Of late years
this practice has, to a great extent, ceased. The people now attribute
an outbreak to the wrath of the goddess K&acirc;l&icirc;, and, to
please her, draw her cart through the streets, and lifting it over the
village boundaries, offer up goats and buffaloes. Sometimes, to keep
off the disease, they make a magic circle with milk or coloured threads
round the village. At N&acirc;sik, when cholera breaks out in the city,
the leading Br&acirc;hmans collect in little doles from each house a
small allowance of rice, put the rice in a cart, take it beyond the
limits of the town, and there it is thrown away.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2871src" href="#xd21e2871" name="xd21e2871src">30</a></p>
<p>A visitation of the plague in Nep&acirc;l was attributed to the
R&acirc;ja insisting on celebrating the Dasahra during an intercalary
month. On another occasion the arrival of the disease was attributed to
the Evil Eye of Saturn and other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144"
href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>planets, which secretly came
together in one sign of the zodiac. A third attack was supposed to be
caused by the R&acirc;ja being in his eighteenth year, and the year of
the cycle being eighty-eight&mdash;eight being a very unlucky
number.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2878src" href="#xd21e2878" name=
"xd21e2878src">31</a></p>
<p>So the Gonds try to ward off the anger of the spirits of cholera and
small-pox by sacrifices, and by thoroughly cleaning their villages and
transferring the sweepings into some road or travelled track. Their
idea is that unless the disease is communicated to some person who will
take it on to the next village, the plague will not leave them. For
this reason they do not throw the sweepings into the jungle, as no one
passes that way, and consequently the benefit of sweeping is
lost.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2883src" href="#xd21e2883" name=
"xd21e2883src">32</a></p>
<p>An extraordinary case was recently reported from the Dehra
Ism&acirc;&icirc;l Kh&acirc;n District. There had been a good deal of
sickness in the village, and the people spread a report that this was
due to the fact that a woman, who had died some seven months
previously, had been chewing her funeral sheet. The relatives were
asked to allow the body to be examined, which was done, and it was
found that owing to the subsidence of the ground through rain, some
earth had fallen into the mouth of the corpse. A copper coin was placed
in the mouth as a viaticum, and a fowl killed and laid on the body,
which was again interred. The same result is very often believed to
follow from burying persons of the sweeper caste in the usual extended
position, instead of a sitting posture or with the face downwards. A
sweeper being one of the aboriginal or casteless tribes is believed to
have something uncanny about him. Recently in Muzaffarnagar, a corpse
buried in the unorthodox way was disinterred by force, and the matter
finally came before the courts.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Demon of Cattle Disease.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the same way cattle disease is caused by the plague
demon. Once upon a time a man, whose descendants live <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>in
the Mathura District, was sleeping out in the fields when he saw the
cattle disease creeping up to his oxen in an animal shape. He watched
his opportunity and got the demon under his shield, which he fixed
firmly down. The disease demon entreated to be released, but he would
not let it go till it promised that it would never remain where he or
his descendants were present. So to this day, when the murrain visits a
village, his descendants are summoned and work round the village,
calling on the disease to fulfil its contract.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2895src" href="#xd21e2895" name="xd21e2895src">33</a></p>
<p>The murrain demon is expelled in the same way as that of the
cholera, and removed by the agency of the scapegoat. In the western
part of the North-Western Provinces you will often notice wisps of
straw tied round the trunks of acacia trees, which, as we shall see,
possess mystic powers, as a means to bar disease.</p>
<p>K&acirc;si B&acirc;ba is the tribal deity of the Binds of Bengal. Of
him it is reported: &ldquo;A mysterious epidemic was carrying off the
herds on the banks of the Ganges, and the ordinary expiatory sacrifices
were ineffectual. One evening a clownish Ah&icirc;r, on going to the
river, saw a figure rinsing its mouth from time to time, and making an
unearthly sound with a conch shell. The lout, concluding that this must
be the demon that caused the epidemic, crept up and clubbed the
unsuspecting bather. K&acirc;si N&acirc;th was the name of the murdered
Br&acirc;hman, and as the cessation of the murrain coincided with his
death, the low Hindust&acirc;ni castes have ever since regarded
K&acirc;si B&acirc;ba as the maleficent spirit that sends disease among
the cattle. Nowadays he is propitiated by the following curious
ceremony. As soon as an infectious disease breaks out, the village
cattle are massed together, and cotton seed sprinkled over them. The
fattest and sleekest animal being singled out, is severely beaten with
rods. The herd, scared by the noise, scamper off to the nearest
shelter, followed by the scape bull; and by this means it is thought
the murrain is stayed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2902src" href=

<p class="first">Beside Hardaul L&acirc;la, the great cholera godling,
Hulk&acirc; Dev&icirc;, the impersonation of vomiting, is worshipped in
Bengal with the same object. She appears to be the same as Holik&acirc;
or Hork&acirc; Maiyy&acirc;, whom we shall meet in connection with the
Hol&icirc; festival. We have already noticed Mar&icirc; or Mar&icirc;
M&acirc;&icirc;, &ldquo;Mother death,&rdquo; or as she is called when
promoted to Br&acirc;hmanism, Mar&icirc; Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;. She and
Hatth&icirc;, a minor cholera goddess, are worshipped when cholera
prevails. By one account she and S&icirc;tal&acirc; are daughters of
R&acirc;ja Vena. About ten thousand people recorded themselves at the
last census as worshippers of Hatth&icirc; and Mar&icirc; in the
North-Western Provinces. Among the jungle tribes of Mirzapur she is
known as Ob&acirc;, an Arabic word (<i>waba</i>) meaning pestilence.
Mar&icirc;, as we have said, has a special shrine in Sult&acirc;npur to
commemorate a fatal outbreak of cholera in the army of Safdar Jang. In
the <span class="corr" id="xd21e2916" title=

an offering of a pumpkin, a male buffalo, a cock, a ram and a goat.
These animals are each decapitated with a single blow before her altar.
If more than one blow is required the ceremony is a failure. Formerly,
in addition to these five kinds of offering a man and woman were

<h3 class="main">Exorcism of Disease.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The practice of exorcising these demons of disease has
been elaborated into something like a science. Disease, according to
the general belief of the rural population, can be removed by a species
of magic, usually of the variety known as &ldquo;sympathetic,&rdquo;
and it can be transferred from the sufferer to some one else. The
special incantations for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>disease are in the hands of
low-caste sorcerers or magicians. Among the more primitive races, such
as those of Dr&acirc;vidian origin in Central India, this is the
business of the Baiga, or aboriginal devil priest. But even here there
is a differentiation of function, and though the Baiga is usually
considered competent to deal with the cases of persons possessed of
evil spirits, it is only special persons who can undertake the regular
exorcism. This is among the lower tribes of Hindus the business of the
Sy&acirc;na, &ldquo;the cunning man,&rdquo; the Sokha (Sanskrit
<i>sukskma</i>, &ldquo;the subtile one&rdquo;), or the Ojha, which is a
corruption of the Sanskrit Up&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya or

</div>
<p>Like &AElig;sculapius, Paieon, and even Apollo himself, the
successful magician and healer gradually develops into a god. All over
the country there are, as we have seen, the shrines of saints who won
the reverence of the people by the cures wrought at their tombs. The
great deified healer in Beh&acirc;r and the eastern Districts of the
North-Western Provinces is Sokha B&acirc;ba, who, according to the last
census, had thirteen thousand special worshippers. He is said to have
been a Br&acirc;hman who was killed by a snake, and now possesses the
power of inflicting snake-bite on those who do not propitiate him.</p>
<p>Exorcisers are both professional and non-professional.
&ldquo;Non-professional exorcisers are generally persons who get
naturally improved by a guardian spirit (<i>deva</i>), and a few of
them learn the art of exorcism from a Guru or teacher. Most of the
professional exorcisers learn from a Guru. The first study is begun on
a lunar or on a solar eclipse day. On such a day the teacher after
bathing, and without wiping his body, or his head or hair, puts on dry
clothes, and goes to the village godling&rsquo;s temple. The candidate
then spreads a white cloth before the god, and on one side of the cloth
makes a heap of rice, and on another a heap of Urad (<i>phaseolus
radiatus</i>), sprinkles red lead on the heaps, and breaks a cocoanut
in front of the idol. The Guru then teaches him the incantation
(<i>mantra</i>), which he commits to memory. An ochre-coloured flag is
then tied to a staff in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>front of the temple, and the
teacher and candidate come home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this, on the first new moon which falls on a Saturday,
the teacher and the candidate go together out of the village to a place
previously marked out by them on the boundary. A servant accompanies
them, who carries a bag of Urad, oil, seven earthen lamps, lemons,
cocoanuts, and red powder. After coming to the spot, the teacher and
the candidate bathe, and then the teacher goes to the village temple,
and sits praying for the safety of the candidate. The candidate, who
has been already instructed as to what should be done, then starts for
the boundary of the next village, accompanied by the servant. On
reaching the village boundary, he picks up seven pebbles, sets them in
a line on the road, and after lighting a lamp near them, he worships
them with flowers, red powder, and Urad. Incense is then burnt, and a
cocoanut is broken near the pebble which represents Vet&acirc;la and
his lieutenants, and a second cocoanut is broken for the village
godling.&rdquo; Here the cocoanut is symbolical of a sacrifice which
was probably originally of a human victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When this is over, he goes to a river, well, or other bathing
place, and bathes, and without wiping his body or putting on dry
clothes, proceeds to the boundary of the next village. There he repeats
the same process as he did before, and then goes to the boundary of a
third village. In this manner he goes to seven villages and repeats the
same process. All this while he keeps on repeating incantations. After
finishing his worship at the seventh village, the candidate returns to
his village, and going to the temple, sees his teacher and tells him
what he has done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this manner, having worshipped and propitiated the
Vet&acirc;las of seven villages, he becomes an exorcist. After having
been able to exercise these powers, he must observe certain rules.
Thus, on every eclipse day he must go to a sea-shore or a river bank,
bathe in cold water, and while standing in the water repeat
incantations a number of times. After bathing daily he must neither
wring his head hair, nor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>wipe his body dry. While he is
taking his meals, he should leave off if he hears a woman in her
monthly sickness speak or if a lamp be extinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Muhammadan methods of studying exorcism are different
from those of the Hindus. One of them is as follows:&mdash;The
candidate begins his study under the guidance of his teacher on the
last day of the lunar month, provided it falls on a Tuesday or Sunday.
The initiation takes place in a room, the walls and floor of which have
been plastered with mud, and here and there daubed with sandal paste.
On the floor a white sheet is spread, and the candidate after washing
his hands and feet, and wearing a new waist-cloth or trousers, sits on
the sheet. He lights one or two incense sticks and makes offerings of a
white cloth and meat to one of the principal Musalm&acirc;n saints.
This process is repeated for from fourteen to forty
days.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2961src" href="#xd21e2961"
name="xd21e2961src">36</a></p>
<p>Few rural exorcisers go through this elaborate ritual, the object of
which it is not difficult to understand. The candidate wishes to get
the Vet&acirc;la or local demon of the village into his power and to
make him work his will. So he provides himself with a number of
articles which, as we shall see, are known for their influence over the
spirits of evil, such as the Urad pulse, lamps, cocoanuts, etc. The
careful rule of bathing, the precautions against personal impurity, the
worship done at the shrine of the village godling by the teacher, are
all intended to guard him in the hour of danger. The common village
&ldquo;wise man&rdquo; contents himself with learning a few charms of
the hocus pocus variety, and a cure in some difficult case of devil
possession secures his reputation as a healer.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Methods of Rural Exorcism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The number of these charms is legion, and most
exorcisers have one of their own in which they place special confidence
and which they are unwilling to disclose. As Sir Monier Williams
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2971src" href="#xd21e2971" name=
"xd21e2971src">37</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;No magician, wizard, sorcerer or
witch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>whose feats are recorded in history, biography
or fable, has ever pretended to be able to accomplish by incantation
and enchantment half of what the Mantra-s&acirc;stri claims to have
power to effect by help of his Mantras. For example, he can
prognosticate futurity, work the most startling prodigies, infuse
breath into dead bodies, kill or humiliate enemies, afflict any one
anywhere with disease or madness, inspire anyone with love, charm
weapons and give them unerring efficacy, enchant armour and make it
impenetrable, turn milk into wine, plants into meat, or invert all such
processes at will. He is even superior to the gods, and can make
goddesses, gods, imps and demons carry out his most trifling behests.
Hence it is not surprising that the following remarkable saying is
everywhere current throughout India: &lsquo;The whole universe is
subject to the gods; the gods are subject to the Mantras; the Mantras
to the Br&acirc;hmans; therefore the Br&acirc;hmans are our
gods.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All these devices of Mantras or spells, Kav&acirc;chas or amulets,
Ny&acirc;sas or mentally assigning various parts of the body to the
protection of tutelary presiding deities, and Mudras or intertwining of
the fingers with a mystic meaning, spring from the corrupt fountain
head of the Tantras, the bible of S&acirc;ktism. But these are the
speciality of the higher class of professional exorciser, who is very
generally a Br&acirc;hman, and do not concern us here.</p>
<p>A few examples of the formul&aelig; used by the village
&ldquo;cunning man&rdquo; may be given here. Thus in Mirzapur when a
person is known to be under the influence of a witch the Ojha recites a
spell, which runs&mdash;&ldquo;Bind the evil eye; bind the fist; bind
the spell; bind the curse; bind the ghost and the churel; bind the
witch&rsquo;s hands and feet. Who can bind her? The teacher can bind
her. I, the disciple of the teacher, can bind her. Go, witch, to
wherever thy shrine may be; sit there and leave the afflicted
person.&rdquo; In these spells Hanum&acirc;n, the monkey godling, is
often invoked. Thus&mdash;&ldquo;I salute the command of my teacher.
Hanum&acirc;n, the hero, is the hero of heroes. He has in his quiver
nine l&acirc;khs of arrows. He is sometimes on the right, sometimes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>on the left, and sometimes in the front. I serve
thee, powerful master. May not this man&rsquo;s body be crippled. I see
the cremation ground in the two worlds and outside them. If in my body
or in the body of this man any ill arise, then I call on the influence
of Hanum&acirc;n. My piety, the power of the teacher, this charm is
true because it comes from the Almighty.&rdquo; In the same way two
great witches, Lon&acirc; Cham&acirc;rin and Ism&acirc;&icirc;l the
Jogi are often invoked. The Musalm&acirc;n calls on Sulaim&acirc;n, the
lord Solomon, who is a leader of demons and a controller of evil
spirits, for which there is ample authority in the Qur&acirc;n.</p>
<p>But it is in charms for disease that the rural exorciser is most
proficient. Accidents, such as the bites of snakes, stings of
scorpions, or wasps are in particular treated in this way, and these
charms make up most of the folk-medicine of Northern India. Thus, when
a man is stung by a scorpion the exorciser says&mdash;&ldquo;Black
scorpion of the limestone! Green is thy tail and black thy mouth. God
orders thee to go home. Come out! Come out! If thou fail to come out
Mah&acirc;deva and P&acirc;rvat&icirc; will drive thee out!&rdquo;
Another spell for scorpion sting runs thus&mdash;&ldquo;On the hill and
mountain is the holy cow. From its dung the scorpions were born, six
black and six brown. Help me! O Nara Sinha! (the man lion incarnation
of Vishnu). Rub each foot with millet and the poison will
depart.&rdquo; So, to cure the bite of a dog, get some clay which has
been worked on a potter&rsquo;s wheel, which as we shall see is a noted
fetish, make a lump of it and rub it to the wound and
say&mdash;&ldquo;The black dog is covered with thick hair.&rdquo;
Another plan in cases of hydrophobia is to kill a dog, and after
burning it to make the patient imbibe the smoke. Headache is caused by
a worm in the head, which comes out if the ear be rubbed with butter.
Women of the gipsy tribes are noted for their charms to take out the
worm which causes toothache. When a man is bitten by a snake the
practitioner says&mdash;&ldquo;True god, true hero, Hanum&acirc;n! The
snake moves in a tortuous way. The male and female weasel come out of
their hole to destroy it. Which poison will they devour? First they
will eat the black Karait snake, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152"
href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>then the snake with the
jewel, then the Ghor snake. I pray to thee for help, my true
teacher.&rdquo; So, if you desire to be safe from the attacks of the
tiger, say&mdash;&ldquo;Tie up the tiger, tie up the tigress, tie up
her seven cubs. Tie up the roads and the footpaths and the fields. O
Vasudeva, have mercy? Have mercy, O Lon&acirc; Cham&acirc;rin!&rdquo;
Lastly, if you desire an appointment, say&mdash;&ldquo;O
K&acirc;l&icirc;, Kank&acirc;l&icirc;, Mah&acirc;k&acirc;li! Thy face
is beautiful, but at thy heart is a serpent. There are four demon
heroes and eighty-four Bhairons. If thou givest the order I will
worship them with betel nuts and sweetmeats. Now
shout&mdash;&lsquo;Mercy, O Mother Kali!&rsquo;&rdquo; It would not be
difficult to describe hundreds of such charms, but what has been
recorded will be sufficient to exemplify the ordinary methods of rural
exorcism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2986src" href="#xd21e2986" name=
"xd21e2986src">38</a></p>
<p>When the Ojha is called in to identify the demon which has beset a
patient, he begins by ascertaining whether it is a local ghost or an
outsider which has attacked him on a journey. Then he calls for some
cloves, and muttering a charm over them, ties them to the bedstead on
which the sick man lies. Then the patient is told to name the ghost
which has possessed him, and he generally names one of his dead
relations, or the ghost of a hill, a tree or a burial ground. Then the
Ojha suggests an appropriate offering, which when bestowed and food
given to Br&acirc;hmans, the patient ought in all decency to recover.
If he does not, the Ojha asserts that the right ghost has not been
named, and the whole process is gone through again, if necessary funds
are forthcoming.</p>
<p>The Baiga of Mirzapur, who very often combines the function of an
Ojha with his own legitimate business of managing the local ghosts,
works in very much the same way. He takes some barley in a sieve, which
as we shall see is a very powerful fetish, and shakes it until only a
few grains are left in the interstices. Then he marks down the
intruding ghost by counting the grains, and recommends the sacrifice of
a fowl or a goat, or the offering of some liquor, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>most
of which he usually consumes himself. If his patient die, he gets out
of the difficulty by saying&mdash;&ldquo;Such and such a powerful
Bh&ucirc;t carried him off. What can a poor man, such as I am,
do?&rdquo; If a tiger or a bear kills a man, the Baiga tells his
friends that such and such a Bh&ucirc;t was offended because no
attention was paid to him, and in revenge entered into the animal which
killed the deceased, the obvious moral being that in future more
regular offerings should be made through the Baiga.</p>
<p>In Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d the Bhomka sorcerer has a handful of
grain waved over the head of the sick man. This is then carried to the
Bhomka, who makes a heap of it on the floor, and sitting over it,
swings a lighted lamp suspended by four strings from his fingers. He
then repeats slowly the names of the patient&rsquo;s ancestors and of
the village and local godling, pausing between each, and when the lamp
stops spinning the name at which it halts is the name to be
propitiated. Then in the same way he asks&mdash;&ldquo;What is the
propitiation offering to be? A pig? A cocoanut? A chicken? A
goat?&rdquo; And the same mystic sign indicates the satisfaction of the
god.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2997src" href="#xd21e2997" name=
"xd21e2997src">39</a></p>
<p>The Kol diviner drops oil into a vessel of water. The name of the
deity is pronounced as the oil is dropped. If it forms one globule in
the water, it is considered that the particular god to be appeased has
been correctly named; if it splutters and forms several globules,
another name is tried. The Or&acirc;on Ojha puts the fowls intended as
victims before a small mud image, on which he sprinkles a few grains of
rice; if they pick at the rice it indicates that the particular devil
represented by the image is satisfied with the intentions of his
votaries, and the sacrifice proceeds.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3002src" href="#xd21e3002" name="xd21e3002src">40</a></p>
<p>The Panj&acirc;b diviner adopts a stock method common to such
practitioners all over the world. He writes some spells on a piece of
paper, and pours on it a large drop of ink. Flowers are then placed in
the hands of a young child, who is told to look into the ink and say,
&ldquo;Summon the four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>guardians.&rdquo; He is asked if
he sees anything in the ink, and according to the answer a result is
arrived at.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3009src" href="#xd21e3009" name=
"xd21e3009src">41</a> The <i>modus operandi</i> of these exorcisers is,
in fact, very much the same in India as in other parts of the
world.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3015src" href="#xd21e3015" name=

<h3 class="main">Exorcism by Dancing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In all rites of this class religious dancing as a
means of scaring the demon of evil holds an important place. Thus of
the Bengal Mu&acirc;sis Col. Dalton writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3025src" href="#xd21e3025" name=
"xd21e3025src">43</a>&mdash;&ldquo;The affection comes on like a fit of
ague, lasting sometimes for a quarter of an hour, the patient or
possessed person writhing and trembling with intense violence,
especially at the commencement of the paroxysm. Then he is seen to
spring from the ground into the air, and a succession of leaps follow,
all executed as though he were shot at by unseen agency. During this
stage of the seizure he is supposed to be quite unconscious, and rolls
into the fire, if there be one, or under the feet of the dancers,
without sustaining injury from the heat or from the pressure. This
lasts for a few minutes only, and is followed by the spasmodic stage.
With hands and knees on the ground and hair loosened, the body is
convulsed, and the head shakes violently, whilst from the mouth issues
a hissing or gurgling noise. The patient next evincing an inclination
to stand on his legs, the bystanders assist him, and place a stick in
his hand, with the aid of which he hops about, the spasmodic action of
the body still continuing, and the head performing by jerks a violently
fatiguing circular movement. This may go on for hours, though Captain
Samuells says that no one in his senses could continue such exertion
for many minutes. When the Baiga is appealed to to cast out the spirit,
he must first ascertain whether it is Gans&acirc;m or one of his
familiars that has possessed the victim. If it be the great
Gans&acirc;m, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155"
name="pb155">155</a>]</span>Baiga implores him to desist, meanwhile
gradually anointing the victim with butter; and if the treatment is
successful, the patient gradually and naturally subsides into a state
of repose, from which he rises into consciousness, and, restored to his
normal state, feels no fatigue or other ill-effects from the
attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same religious dance of ecstasy appears in what is known as the
R&acirc;s Mandala of the modern Vaishnava sects, which is supposed to
represent the dance of the Gop&icirc;s with Krishna. So in Bombay among
the Mar&acirc;thas the worship of the chief goddess of the <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e3032" title="Source: Dakkin">Dakkhin</span>,
Tulj&acirc; Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;, is celebrated by a set of dancing
devotees, called Gondhalis, whose leader becomes possessed by the
goddess. A high stool is covered with a black cloth. On the cloth
thirty-six pinches of rice are dropped in a heap, and with them
turmeric and red powder, all scarers of demons, are mixed. On the rice
is set a copper vessel filled with milk and water, and in this the
goddess is supposed to take her abode. Over it are laid betel leaves
and a cocoanut. Five torches are carried round the vessel by five men,
each shouting &ldquo;Amb&acirc; Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;!&rdquo; The music
plays, and dancers dance before her. So at a Br&acirc;hman marriage at
P&ucirc;na the boy and girl are seated on the shoulders of their
maternal uncles or other relations, who perform a frantic dance, the
object being, as in all these cases, to scare away the spirits of
evil.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3035src" href="#xd21e3035" name=

<h3 class="main">Flagellation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So with flagellation, which all over the world is
supposed to have the power of scaring demons. Thus in the Central
Indian Hills the Baiga with his Gurda, or sacred chain, which being
made of iron, possesses additional potency, soundly thrashes patients
attacked with epilepsy, hysteria, and similar ailments, which from
their nature are obviously due to demoniacal agency. There are numerous
instances of the use of the lash for this purpose. In Bombay, among the
Ling&acirc;yats, the woman who names the child has her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>back
beaten with gentle blows; and some beggar Br&acirc;hmans refuse to take
alms until the giver beats them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3045src"
href="#xd21e3045" name="xd21e3045src">45</a> There is a famous shrine

patients to drive out the disease demon.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Treatment of Sorcerers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While the sorcerer by virtue of his profession is
generally respected and feared, in some places they have been dealt
with rather summarily. There is everywhere a struggle between the
Br&acirc;hman priest of the greater gods and the exorciser, who works
by the agency of demons. Sudarsan S&acirc;h rid Garhw&acirc;l of them
by summoning all the professors of the black art with their books. When
they were collected he had them bound hand and foot and thrown with
their books and implements into the river. The same monarch also
disposed very effectually of a case of possession in his own family.
One day he heard a sound of drumming and dancing in one of his
courtyards, and learnt that a ghost named Goril had taken possession of
one of his female slaves. The R&acirc;ja was wroth, and taking a thick
bamboo, he proceeded to the spot and laid about him so vigorously that
the votaries of Goril soon declared that the deity had taken his
departure. The R&acirc;ja then ordered Goril to cease from possessing
people, and nowadays if any Garhw&acirc;li thinks himself possessed, he
has only to call on the name of Sudarsan S&acirc;h and the demon
departs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3065src" href="#xd21e3065" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Appointment of Ojhas.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The mode of succession to the dignity of an Ojha
varies in different places. In Mirzapur the son is usually educated by
his father, and taught the various spells and modes of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>incantation. But this is not always the case;
and here at the present time the institution is in a transition stage.
South of the Son we have the Baiga, who usually acts as an Ojha also;
and he is invariably drawn from the aboriginal races. Further north he
is known as N&acirc;ya (Sanskrit <i>n&acirc;yaka</i>) or
&ldquo;leader.&rdquo; Further north, again, as we leave the hilly
country and enter the completely Br&acirc;hmanized Gangetic valley, he
changes into the regular Ojha, who is always a low-class
Br&acirc;hman.</p>
<p>In one instance which came under my own notice, the N&acirc;ya of
the village had been an aboriginal Kol, and he before his death
announced that &ldquo;the god had sat on the head&rdquo; of a
Br&acirc;hman candidate for the office, who was duly initiated, and is
now the recognized village Ojha. This is a good example of the way in
which Br&acirc;hmanism annexes and absorbs the demonolatry of the lower
races. This, too, enables us to correct a statement which has been made
even by such a careful inquirer as Mr. Sherring when he says<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3081src" href="#xd21e3081" name=
"xd21e3081src">48</a>&mdash;&ldquo;Formerly the Ojha was always a
Br&acirc;hman; but his profession has become so lucrative that sharp,
clever, shrewd men in all the Hindu castes have taken to it.&rdquo;
There can be no question that the process has been the very reverse of
this, and that the early Ojhas were aboriginal sorcerers, and that
their trade was taken over by the Br&acirc;hman as the land became
Hinduized.</p>
<p>In Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d the son usually succeeds his father, but
a Bhomka does not necessarily marry into a Bhomka family, nor does it
follow that &ldquo;once a Bhomka, always a Bhomka.&rdquo; On the
contrary, the position seems to be the result of the special favour of
the godling of the particular village in which he lives; and if the
whole of the residents emigrate in a body, then the godling of the new
village site will have to be consulted afresh as to the servant whom he
chooses to attend upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a Bhomka dies or goes away, or a new village is
established, his successor is appointed in the following way.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>All the villagers assemble at the shrine of
Mutua Deo, and offer a black and white chicken to him. A Parih&acirc;r,
or priest, should be enticed to grace the solemnity and make the
sacrifice, but if that cannot be done the oldest man in the assembly
does it. Then he sets a wooden grain measure rolling along the line of
seated people, and the man before whom it stops is marked out by the
intervention of the deity as the new Bhomka.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3090src" href="#xd21e3090" name="xd21e3090src">49</a></p>
<p>It marks perhaps some approximation to Hinduism that the priest,
when inspired by the god, wears a thread made of the hair of a
bullock&rsquo;s tail, unless this is based on the common use of thread
or hair as a scarer of demons, or is some token or fetish peculiar to
the race. At the same time the non-Br&acirc;hmanic character of the
worship is proved by the fact that the priest, when in a state of
ecstasy, cannot bear the presence of a cow, or Br&acirc;hman.
&ldquo;The god,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;would leave their heads if
either of these came near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one occasion, when Sir C. A. Elliott saw the process of exorcism,
the men did not actually revolve when &ldquo;the god came on his
head.&rdquo; He covered his head up well in a cloth, leaving space for
the god to approach, and in this state he twisted and turned himself
rapidly, and soon sat down exhausted. We shall see elsewhere that the
head is one of the chief spirit entries, and the top of the head is
left uncovered in order to let the spirit make its way through the
sutures of the skull. Then from the pit of his stomach he uttered words
which the bystanders interpreted to direct a certain line of conduct
for the sick man to pursue. &ldquo;But perhaps the occasion was not a
fair test, as the Parih&acirc;r strongly objected to the presence of an
unbeliever, on the pretence that the god would be afraid to come before
so great an official.&rdquo; This has always been the standing
difficulty in Europeans obtaining a practical knowledge of the details
of rural sorcery, and when a performance of the kind is specially
arranged, it will usually be found that the officiant performs the

comes to the crucial point he breaks down, just as the ecstatic crisis
should have commenced. This is always attributed to the presence of an
unbeliever, however interested and sympathetic. The same result usually
happens at spiritualistic s&eacute;ances, when anyone with even an
elementary knowledge of physics or mechanics happens to be one of the

<h3 class="main">Fraud in Exorcism.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The question naturally arises&mdash;Are all these
Ojhas and Baigas conscious hypocrites and swindlers? Dr. Tylor shrewdly
remarks that &ldquo;the sorcerer generally learns his time-honoured
profession in good faith, and retains the belief in it more or less
from first to last. At once dupe and cheat, he combines the energy of a
believer with the cunning of a hypocrite.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3104src" href="#xd21e3104" name="xd21e3104src">50</a> This
coincides with the experience of most competent Indian observers. No
one who consults a Sy&acirc;na and observes the confident way in which
he asserts his mystic power, can doubt that he at least believes to a
large extent in the sacredness of his mission. Captain Samuells, who
repeatedly witnessed these performances, distinctly asserts that it is
a mistake to suppose that there is always intentional
deception.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3107src" href="#xd21e3107" name=

<h3 class="main">Disease Charms.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next to the services of the professional exorciser for
the purpose of preventing or curing disease, comes the use of special
charms for this purpose. There is a large native literature dealing
with this branch of science. As a rule most native patients undergo a
course of this treatment before they visit our hospitals, and the
result of European medical science is hence occasionally disappointing.
One favourite talisman of this kind is the magic square, which consists
in an arrangement of certain numbers in a special <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>way.
For instance, in order to cure barrenness, it is a good plan to write a
series of numbers which added up make 73 both ways on a piece of bread,
and with it feed a black dog, which is the attendant of Bhairon, a
giver of offspring. To cure a tumour a figure in the form of a cross is
drawn with three cyphers in the centre and one at each of the four
ends. This is prepared on a Sunday and tied round the left arm. Another
has a series of numbers aggregating 15 every way. This is engraved on
copper and tied round a child&rsquo;s neck to keep off the Evil Eye. In
the case of cattle disease, some gibberish, which pretends to be Arabic
or Sanskrit, appealing for the aid of Lon&acirc; Cham&acirc;rin or
Ism&acirc;&icirc;l Jogi, with a series of mystic numbers, is written on
a piece of tile. This is hung on a rope over the village cattle path,
and a ploughshare is buried at the entrance to make the charm more
powerful. When cattle are attacked with worms, the owner fills a clean
earthen pot with water drawn from the well with one hand; he then
mutters a blessing, and with some sacred D&acirc;bh grass sprinkles a
little water seven times along the back of the animal.</p>

<p class="figureHead">HOUSE PROTECTED AGAINST THE EVIL EYE.</p>
</div>
<p>The number of these charms is legion. Many of them merge into the
special preservatives against the Evil Eye, which will be discussed
later on. Thus the b&acirc;z&acirc;r merchant writes the words
<i>R&acirc;m! R&acirc;m!</i> several times near his door, or he makes a
representation of the sun and moon, or a rude image of Ganesa, the
godling of good luck, or draws the mystical Sw&acirc;stika. A house of
a banker at Kankhal which I recently examined bore a whole gallery of
pictures round it. There were Siva and P&acirc;rvat&icirc; on an ox
with their son M&acirc;rkandeya; Yamar&acirc;ja, the deity of death,
with a servant waving a fan over his head; Krishna with his spouse
R&acirc;dh&acirc;: Hanum&acirc;n, the monkey godling; the Ganges riding
on a fish, with Bh&acirc;g&icirc;ratha, who brought her down from
heaven; Bh&icirc;shma, the hero of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata; Arjuna
representing the P&acirc;ndavas; the saints Uddalaka and N&acirc;rada
Muni; Ganesa with his two maidservants; and Brahma and Vishnu riding on
Sesha N&acirc;ga, the great serpent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Rag Offerings.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next come the arrangements by which disease may be
expelled or transferred to someone else. In this connection we may
discuss the curious custom of hanging up rags on trees or near sacred
wells. Of this custom India supplies numerous examples. At the Balchha
pass in Garhw&acirc;l there is a small heap of stones at the summit,
with sticks and rags attached to them, to which travellers add a stone
or two as they pass.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3134src" href=
"#xd21e3134" name="xd21e3134src">52</a> In Persia they fix rags on
bushes in the name of the Im&acirc;m Raza. They explain the custom by
saying that the eye of the Im&acirc;m being always on the top of the
mountain, the shreds which are left there by those who hold him in
reverence, remind him of what he ought to do in their behalf with
Muhammad, &rsquo;Ali and the other holy personages, who are able to
propitiate the Almighty in their favour.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3137src" href="#xd21e3137" name="xd21e3137src">53</a> Moorcroft
in his journey to Lad&acirc;kh describes how he propitiated the evil
spirit of a dangerous pass with the leg of a pair of worn-out nankin
trousers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3140src" href="#xd21e3140" name=
"xd21e3140src">54</a> Among the Mirzapur Korwas the Baiga hangs rags on
the trees which shade the village shrine, as a charm to bring health
and good luck. These rag shrines are to be found all over the country,
and are generally known as Chithariy&acirc; or Chithraiy&acirc;
Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;, &ldquo;Our Lady of Tatters.&rdquo; So in the
Panj&acirc;b the trees on which rags are hung are called Lingr&icirc;
P&icirc;r or the rag saint.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3143src" href=
"#xd21e3143" name="xd21e3143src">55</a> The same custom prevails at
various Him&acirc;layan shrines and at the Vastra Harana or sacred tree
at Brindaban near Mathura, which is now invested with a special legend,
as commemorating the place where Krishna carried off the clothes of the
milkmaids when they were bathing, an incident which constantly appears
in both European and Indian folk-lore.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3146src" href="#xd21e3146" name="xd21e3146src">56</a> In
Ber&acirc;r a heap of stones daubed with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>red and placed under
a tree fluttering with rags represents Chindiya Deo or &ldquo;the Lord
of Tatters,&rdquo; where, if you present a rag in due season, you may
chance to get new clothes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3152src" href=
"#xd21e3152" name="xd21e3152src">57</a> The practice of putting or
tying rags from the person of the sick to a tree, especially a banyan,
cocoanut, or some thorny tree, is prevalent in the Konkan, but not to
such an extent as that of fixing nails or tying bottles to trees. In
the Konkan, when a person is suffering from a spirit disease, the
exorcist takes the spirit away from the sick man and fixes it in a tree
by thrusting a nail in it. We have already had an example of this
treatment of ghosts by the Baiga. Sometimes he catches the spirit of
the disease in a bottle and ties the bottle to a tree.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3155src" href="#xd21e3155" name=
"xd21e3155src">58</a> In a well-known story of the Arabian Knights the
Jinn is shut up in a bottle under the seal of the Lord Solomon.</p>
<p>There have been various explanations of this custom of hanging rags
on trees.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3160src" href="#xd21e3160" name=
"xd21e3160src">59</a> One is that they are offerings to the local deity
of the tree. Mr. Gomme quotes an instance of an Irishman who made a
similar offering with the following invocation: &ldquo;To St.
Columbkill&mdash;I offer up this button, a bit o&rsquo; the waistband
o&rsquo; my own breeches, an&rsquo; a taste o&rsquo; my wife&rsquo;s
petticoat, in <span class="corr" id="xd21e3163" title=
"Source: remimbrance">remembrance</span> of us havin&rsquo; made this
holy station; an&rsquo; may they rise up in glory to prove it for us in
the last day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He &ldquo;points to the undoubted nature of the offerings and their
service, in the identification of their owners&mdash;a service which
implies their power to bear witness in spirit-land to the pilgrimage of
those who deposited them during lifetime at the sacred well.&rdquo;
Some of the Indian evidence seems to show that these rags are really
offerings to the sacred tree. Thus, Colonel Tod<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3168src" href="#xd21e3168" name="xd21e3168src">60</a> describes
the trees in a sacred grove in R&acirc;jput&acirc;na as decorated with
shreds of various coloured cloth, &ldquo;offerings of the traveller to
the forest divinity for protection against evil spirits.&rdquo; This
usage often merges <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163"
name="pb163">163</a>]</span>into actual tree-worship, as among the
Mirzapur Pat&acirc;ris, who, when fever prevails, tie a cotton string
which has never touched water round the trunk of a P&icirc;pal tree,
and hang rags from the branches. So, the Kharw&acirc;rs have a sacred
Mahua tree, known as the By&acirc;hi Mahua or &ldquo;Mahua of
marriage,&rdquo; on which threads are hung at marriages. At almost any
holy place women may be seen winding a cotton thread round the trunk of
a P&icirc;pal tree.</p>
<p>Another explanation is that the hanging of the rags is done with the
object of transferring a disease to some one else. Professor Rhys
suggests that a distinction is to be drawn between the rags hung on
trees or near a well and the pins, which are so commonly thrown into
the water itself. It is noteworthy that in some cases the pins are
replaced by buttons, or even by copper coins. The rags, on the other
hand, he thinks may be vehicles of the disease. To this Mr. Hartland
objects&mdash;&ldquo;If this opinion were correct, one would expect to
find both ceremonies performed by the same patient at the same well; he
would throw in the pin and also place the rag on the bush, or wherever
its proper place might be. The performance of both ceremonies is,
however, I think, exceptional. Where the pin or button is dropped into
the well, the patient does not trouble about the rag, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes on to say that &ldquo;the curious detail mentioned by Mrs.
Evans in reference to the rags tied on the bushes at St. Elian&rsquo;s
well&mdash;namely, that they must be tied with wool&mdash;points to a
still further degradation of the rite in the case we are now examining.
Probably at one time rags were used and simply tied to the sacred tree
with wool. What may have been the reason for using wool remains to be
discovered. But it is easy to see how, if the reason were lost, the
wool might be looked on as the essential condition of the due
performance of the ceremony, and so continue after the disuse of the
rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reference to this it may be noted that there is some reason to
believe that the sheep was a sacred animal. In Western India high-caste
Hindus wear blankets after bathing. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>The Kunbis use a
mixture of sheep&rsquo;s milk with lime juice and opium as a cure for
diarrh&oelig;a. The Parheyas of Bengal used to wash their houses with
sheep&rsquo;s dung to scare spirits. And the use of woollen clothes in
certain rites is prescribed in the current ritual.</p>
<p>Mr. Hartland is inclined to think that the rags represent entire
articles of clothing which were at an earlier time deposited, and on
the analogy of the habit of the witch of getting hold of some part of
the body, such as nail-cuttings and so on, by which she may get the
owner into her power, the rags were meant to connect the worshipper
with the deity. &ldquo;In like manner my shirt or stocking, or a rag to
represent it, placed upon a sacred bush or thrust into a sacred well,
my name written on the walls of a temple, a stone or pellet from my
hand cast upon a sacred image or a sacred cairn, is thenceforth in
constant contact with divinity; and the effluence of divinity, reaching
and involving it, will reach and involve me. In this way I may be
permanently united with the god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is quite possible that some or all of the ideas thus given may
have resulted in the present practice in India.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Disease Transference.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Disease is also transferred in an actual physical way.
Thus, in Ireland, a charm or curse is left on a gate or stile, and the
first healthy person who passes through will, it is believed, have the
disease transferred to him. So, in Scotland, if a child is affected
with the whooping cough, it is taken into the land of another laird,
and there the disease is left.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3193src"
href="#xd21e3193" name="xd21e3193src">61</a> Similarly, in Northern
India, one way of transferring disease is to fill a pot with flowers
and rice and bury it in a path, with a stone to cover it. Whoever
touches this is supposed to contract the disease. This is known as
Chalauwa, which means &ldquo;passing on&rdquo; the malady. This goes on
daily in Upper India. Often when walking in a b&acirc;z&acirc;r in the
early morning, you will see a little pile of earth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>decorated with flowers in the middle of the
road. This usually contains some of the scabs or scales from the body
of a small-pox patient, which are placed there in the hope that someone
may touch them, contract the malady and thus relieve the sufferer. In
1885 it was officially reported that in Cawnpur small-pox had greatly
increased from the practice of placing these scales on the roads. At
the instance of Government the matter was investigated, and it was
found that in the early stages of the disease, the Diuli ceremony is
performed at cross-roads; and that at a later period the crusts from
smallpox patients mixed with curdled milk and cocoanut juice are
carried to the temple or platform of the small-pox goddess and are
dedicated to her.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3198src" href="#xd21e3198"
name="xd21e3198src">62</a></p>
<p>One morning, in a village near Agra, I came by chance on two old
women fiercely quarrelling. On making inquiries, I found that one of
them had placed some small-pox crusts from her child on her
neighbour&rsquo;s threshold. The people agreed that this was a wicked
act, as it displayed special animus against a particular person. If
they had been placed on the cross-road, and any one had been unlucky
enough to touch them and contract the disease, it would not have
mattered much&mdash;that was the will of God.</p>
<p>Some time ago an indigo planter, near Benares, was astonished by a
respectable native friend asking the loan of one of his geese. On
inquiry he ascertained that his friend&rsquo;s son was suffering from
bowel complaint, and that he had been advised by a native physician to
get a goose, place it in the boy&rsquo;s bed, and that the disease
would be communicated to the bird, with the result of curing the
patient. This remedy was known in Italy. One of the prescriptions of
Marcellus runs:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3205src" href="#xd21e3205"
name="xd21e3205src">63</a> &ldquo;To those who are suffering from a
colic. Let them fasten a live duck to their stomachs, thus the disease
will pass from the man to the duck, and the duck will die.&rdquo; In
the same way when any one wants to set their neighbour&rsquo;s
household at variance, a quill of a porcupine, which is supposed to be
a quarrelsome animal, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>is thrown over the wall. On this
principle in Italy a short and simple method of setting people by the
ears is to buy some of the herb Discordia and throw it into a house,
when the result is sure to be a vendetta.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3210src" href="#xd21e3210" name="xd21e3210src">64</a> In the
Indian Hills, in case of illness a stake is driven down into the earth
where four roads meet, and certain drugs and grains are buried close
by, which are speedily disinterred and eaten by crows. This gives
immediate relief to the sufferer.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3213src"
href="#xd21e3213" name="xd21e3213src">65</a> Here the idea apparently
is, that the disease is transferred to the crow, a sacred bird, and in
close communication with the spirits of the sainted dead. So in cases
of cattle disease, a buffalo&rsquo;s skull, a small lamb, fire in a
pan, vessels of butter and milk, wisps of grass and branches of the
Siras tree (<i>Acacia speciosa</i>) are thrown over the boundary of
another village and are supposed to carry the disease demon with them.
This often causes a riot.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3220src" href=
"#xd21e3220" name="xd21e3220src">66</a> In the same way, killing
buffaloes and putting their heads in the next village removes cholera,
and by pouring oil on grain and burning it, the disease flies elsewhere
in the smoke. This seems to be one of the principles which underlie the
general practice of fire sacrifice.</p>

<h3 class="main">Scapegoats.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This brings us to the regular scapegoat. At shrines of
S&icirc;tal&acirc;, the small-pox goddess, sweepers bring round a small
pig. Contributions are called for from the worshippers, and when the
value of the animal is made up, it is driven by the people into the
jungle, pursued by an excited crowd, who believe that the creature has
taken the disease with it.</p>
<p>General Sleeman gives an excellent example of this custom.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3230src" href="#xd21e3230" name=
"xd21e3230src">67</a> &ldquo;More than four-fifths of the city and
cantonments of S&acirc;gar had been affected by a violent influenza,
which, commencing with a violent cough, was followed by a fever and in
some cases terminated in death. I had an application <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>from
the old Queen Dowager of S&acirc;gar, to allow of a noisy religious
procession for the purpose of imploring deliverance from this great
calamity. The women and children in this procession were to do their
utmost to add to the noise by raising their voices in psalmody, beating
upon their brass pans and pots with all their might, and discharging
firearms where they could get them. Before the noisy crowd was to be
driven a buffalo, which had been purchased by general subscription, in
order that every family might participate in the merit. They were to
follow it out eight miles, where it was to be turned out for anyone who
would take it. If the animal returned, the disease must return with it,
and the ceremony be performed over again. I was requested to intimate
the circumstances to the officer commanding the troops in cantonments,
in order that the noise they intended to make might not excite any
alarm and bring down upon them the visit of the soldiery. It was,
however, subsequently determined that the animal should be a goat, and
he was driven before the crowd. Accordingly, I have on several
occasions been requested to allow of such noisy ceremonies in cases of
epidemics, and the confidence the people feel in their efficacy has, no
doubt, a good effect.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Demons Scared by Noise.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This incidentally leads to the consideration of the
principle that evil spirits are scared by noise. In the first place
this appears largely to account for the use of bells in religious
worship. The tolling of the bells keeps off the evil spirits which
throng round any place where the worship of the regular gods is being
performed. Milton speaks of&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The bellman&rsquo;s drowsy charm;</p>
<p class="line">To bless the doors from nightly harm.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3245src" href="#xd21e3245" name=
"xd21e3245src">68</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">So, the passing bell protects the departing soul as it
flies through the air from demoniacal influence. As Grose
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3250src" href="#xd21e3250" name=
"xd21e3250src">69</a>&mdash;&ldquo;The <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3253" title="Source: passsing">passing</span> bell was anciently
rung for two purposes; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href=
"#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>one to bespeak the prayers of all
good Christians for a soul just departing; the other, to drive away the
evil spirits who stood at the bed&rsquo;s foot, and about the house,
ready to seize their prey, or at least to molest and terrify the soul
in its passage; but by the ringing of that bell (for Durandus informs
us evil spirits are much afraid of bells), they were kept aloof, and
the soul, like a hunted hare, gained the start, or had what is by
sportsmen called &lsquo;law.&rsquo;&rdquo; The keening at an Irish wake
is probably a survival of the same custom. But Panj&acirc;bi
Musalm&acirc;ns have a prejudice against beating a brass tray, as it is
believed to disturb the dead, who wake, supposing the Day of Judgment
has arrived.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3258src" href="#xd21e3258"
name="xd21e3258src">70</a></p>
<p>Another fact which adds to the efficacy of bells for this purpose,
is that they are made of metal, which, as we shall see elsewhere, is a
well-known scarer of demons.</p>
<p>Hence in Indian temples the use of the bell, or resounding shell
trumpet, is universal. The intention is to call the divinity and wake
him from his sleep, so that he may consume the offerings prepared for
him by his votaries, and to scare vagrant ghosts, who would otherwise
partake of the meal. On the same principle the drum is, as we have
seen, a sacred instrument. The same is the case with bells. The Todas
of Madras worship Hiriya Deva, whose representative is the sacred
buffalo bell, which hangs from the neck of the finest buffalo in the
sacred herd.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3265src" href="#xd21e3265"
name="xd21e3265src">71</a> The Gonds have also elevated the bell into a
deity in the form of Gh&acirc;garapen, and one special class of their
devil priests, the Ojhy&acirc;ls, always wear bells.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3268src" href="#xd21e3268" name="xd21e3268src">72</a> So, the
Pat&acirc;ri priest in Mirzapur and many classes of ascetics throughout
the country carry bells and rattles made of iron, which they move as
they walk to scare demons. Iron, it need hardly be said, is most
efficacious for this purpose. This also accounts for the music played
at weddings, when the young pair are in special danger from the attacks
of evil spirits. At many rites it is the rule to clap the hands at a
special part of the ritual with the same purpose. The
R&acirc;&ecirc;d&acirc;si Cham&acirc;rs and many other people shout or
sing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>loudly as they remove a corpse for burial or
cremation, and there are few magistrates in India who have not been
asked for leave by some happy father to allow guns to be fired from his
house-top to drive evil spirits from the mother and her child. Mr.
Campbell records that they fire a gun over the back of a sick cow in
Scotland with the same intention.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3273src"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To return to the use of the scape animal as a means of
expelling disease. In Ber&acirc;r, if cholera is very severe, the
people get a scapegoat or young buffalo, but in either case it must be
a female and as black as possible, the latter condition being based on
the fact that Yamar&acirc;ja, the lord of death, uses such an animal as
his vehicle. They then tie some grain, cloves and red lead (all demon
scarers) on its back and turn it out of the village. A man of the
gardener caste takes the goat outside the boundary, and it is not
allowed to return.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3281src" href=
"#xd21e3281" name="xd21e3281src">74</a> So among the Korwas of
Mirzapur, when cholera begins, a black cock, and when it is severe, a
black goat, is offered by the Baiga at the shrine of the village
godling, and he then drives the animal off in the direction of some
other village. After it has gone a little distance, the Baiga, who is
protected from evil by virtue of his holy office, follows it, kills it
and eats it. Among the Pat&acirc;ris in cholera epidemics the elders of
the village and the Ojha wizard feed a black fowl with grain and drive
it beyond the boundary, ordering it to take the plague with it. If the
resident of another village finds such a fowl and eats it, cholera
comes with it into his village. Hence, when disease prevails, people
are very cautious about meddling with strange fowls. When these animals
are sent off, a little oil, red lead, and a woman&rsquo;s forehead
spangle are put upon it, a decoration which, perhaps, points to a
survival of an actual sacrifice to appease the demon of disease. When
such an animal comes into a village, the Baiga takes it to the local
shrine, worships it and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href=
"#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>then passes it on quietly outside
the boundary. Among the Kharw&acirc;rs, when rinderpest attacks the
cattle, they take a black cock, put some red lead on its head, some
antimony on its eyes, a spangle on its forehead, and fixing a pewter
bangle to its leg, let it loose, calling to the
disease&mdash;&ldquo;Mount on the fowl and go elsewhere into the
ravines and thickets; destroy the sin!&rdquo; This dressing up of the
scape animal in a woman&rsquo;s ornaments and trinkets is almost
certainly a relic of some grosser form of expiation in which a human
being was sacrificed. We have another survival of the same practice in
the Panj&acirc;b custom, which directs that when cholera prevails, a
man of the Cham&acirc;r or currier caste, one of the hereditary
menials, should be branded on the buttocks and turned out of the
village.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3286src" href="#xd21e3286" name=
"xd21e3286src">75</a></p>
<p>A curious modification of the ordinary scape animal, of which it is
unnecessary to give any more instances, comes from Kulu.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3291src" href="#xd21e3291" name=
"xd21e3291src">76</a> &ldquo;The people occasionally perform an
expiatory ceremony with the object of removing ill-luck or evil
influence, which is supposed to be brooding over the hamlet. The
godling (Deota) of the place is, as usual, first consulted through his
disciple (Chela) and declares himself also under the influence of a
charm and advises a feast, which is given in the evening at the temple.
Next morning a man goes round from house to house, a creel on his back,
into which each family throws all sorts of odds and ends, parings of
nails, pinches of salt, bits of old iron, handfuls of grain, etc. The
whole community then turns out and perambulates the village, at the
same time stretching an unbroken thread round it, fastened to pegs at
the four corners. This done, the man with the creel carries it down to
the river bank and empties the contents therein, and a sheep, fowl, and
some small animals are sacrificed on the spot. Half the sheep is the
property of the man who dares to carry the creel, and he is also
entertained from house to house on the following night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is obvious that this exactly corresponds with the old English
custom of sin-eating. Thus we read:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3296src"
href="#xd21e3296" name="xd21e3296src">77</a>&mdash;&ldquo;Within
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, when a
person died, there was a notice given to an old sire (for so they
called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased
lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family
came out and furnished him with a cricket on which he sat down facing
the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a
crust of bread, which he ate; and a full bowl of ale, which he drank
off at a draught. After this he got out from the cricket and
pronounced, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of the soul
departed, for which he would pawn his own soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are other Indian customs based on the same principle.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3303src" href="#xd21e3303" name=
"xd21e3303src">78</a> Thus, in the Amb&acirc;la District a
Br&acirc;hman named Nathu stated &ldquo;that he had eaten food out of
the hand of the R&acirc;ja of Bil&acirc;spur, after his death, and that
in consequence he had for the space of one year been placed on the
throne at Bil&acirc;spur. At the end of the year he had been given
presents, including a village, and had then been turned out of
Bil&acirc;spur territory and forbidden apparently to return. Now he is
an outcast among his co-religionists, as he has eaten food out of the
dead man&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; So at the funeral ceremonies of the late
R&acirc;n&icirc; of Chamba, it is said that rice and ghi were placed in
the hands of the corpse, which a Br&acirc;hman consumed on payment of a
fee. The custom has given rise to a class of outcast Br&acirc;hmans in
the Hill States about K&acirc;ngra. In another account of the funeral
rites of the R&acirc;n&icirc; of Chamba, it is added that after the
feeding of the Br&acirc;hman, as already described, &ldquo;a stranger,
who had been caught beyond Chamba territory, was given the costly
wrappings round the corpse, a new bed and a change of raiment, and then
told to depart, and never to show his face in Chamba again.&rdquo; At
the death of a respectable Hindu the clothes and other belongings of
the dead man are, in the same way, given to the Mah&acirc;br&acirc;hman
or funeral priest. This seems to be partly based on the principle that
he, by using these articles, passes them on for the use of the deceased
in the land of death; but the detestation and contempt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>felt
for this class of priest may be, to some extent, based on the idea that
by the use of these articles he takes upon his head the sins of the
dead man.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3311src" href="#xd21e3311" name=
"xd21e3311src">79</a></p>
<p>Again, writing of the customs prevailing among the R&acirc;jput
tribes of Oudh which practise female infanticide, Gen. Sleeman
writes:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3316src" href="#xd21e3316" name=
"xd21e3316src">80</a>&mdash;&ldquo;The infant is destroyed in the room
where it was born, and there buried. The room is then plastered over
with cow-dung, and on the thirteenth day after, the village or family
priest must cook and eat his food in this room. He is provided with
wood, ghi, barley, rice, and sesamum. He boils the rice, barley, and
sesamum in a brass vessel, throws the ghi over them when they are
dressed, and eats the whole. This is considered as a Homa or burnt
offering, and by eating it in that place, the priest is supposed to
take the whole Hatya or sin upon himself, and to cleanse the family
from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, in Central India the Gonds in November assemble at the shrine of
Gansy&acirc;m Deo to worship him. Sacrifices of fowls and spirits, or a
pig, occasionally, according to the size of the village, are offered,
and Gansy&acirc;m Deo is said to descend on the head of one of the
worshippers, who is suddenly seized with a kind of fit, and after
staggering about for a while, rushes off into the wildest jungles,
where the popular theory is that, if not pursued and brought back, he
would inevitably die of starvation, and become a raving lunatic. As it
is, after being brought back by one or two men, he does not recover his
senses for one or two days. The idea is that one man is thus singled
out as a scapegoat for the sins of the rest of the village.</p>
<p>In the final stage we find the scape animal merging into a regular
expiatory sacrifice. Other examples will be given in another connection
of the curious customs, like that of the Irish and Manxland rites of
hunting the wren, which are almost certainly based on the principle of
a sacrifice. Here it may be noted that at one of their festivals, the
Bh&ucirc;mij <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>used to drive two male buffaloes into a small
enclosure, while the R&acirc;ja and his suite used to witness the
proceedings. They first discharged arrows at the animals, and the
tormented and enraged beasts fell to and gored each other, while arrow
after arrow was discharged. When the animals were past doing very much
mischief, the people rushed in and hacked them to pieces with axes.
This custom is now discontinued.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3325src"
href="#xd21e3325" name="xd21e3325src">81</a></p>
<p>Similarly in the Hills, at the Nand Ashtam&icirc;, or feast in
honour of Nanda, the foster father of Krishna, a buffalo is specially
fed with sweetmeats, and, after being decked with a garland round the
neck, is worshipped. The headman of the village then lays a sword
across its neck and the beast is let loose, when all proceed to chase
it, pelt it with stones, and hack it with knives until it dies. It is
curious that this savage rite is carried out in connection with the
worship of the Krishna Cultus, in which blood sacrifice finds no
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3330src" href="#xd21e3330" name=
"xd21e3330src">82</a></p>
<p>In the same part of the country the same rite is performed after a
death, on the analogy of the other instances, which have been already
quoted. When a man dies, his relations assemble at the end of the year
in which the death occurred, and the nearest male relative dances naked
(another instance of the nudity charm, to which reference has been
already made) with a drawn sword in his hand, to the music of a drum,
in which he is assisted by others for a whole day and night. The
following day a buffalo is brought and made intoxicated with Bhang or
Indian hemp, and spirits, and beaten to death with sticks, stones and
weapons.</p>
<p>So, the Hill Bhotiyas have a feast in honour of the village god, and
towards evening they take a dog, make him drunk with spirits and hemp,
and kill him with sticks and stones, in the belief that no disease or
misfortune will visit the village during the year.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3337src" href="#xd21e3337" name="xd21e3337src">83</a> At the
periodical feast in honour of the mountain goddess of the
Him&acirc;laya, Nand&acirc; Dev&icirc;, it is said that a four-horned
goat is invariably born and accompanies the pilgrims. When unloosed on
the mountain, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"
name="pb174">174</a>]</span>sacred goat suddenly disappears and as
suddenly reappears without its head, and then furnishes food for the
party. The head is supposed to be consumed by the goddess herself, who
by accepting it with its load of sin, washes away the transgressions of
her votaries. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=

<h3 class="main">Ancestor-worship: its Origin.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The worship of ancestors is one of the main branches
of the religion of the Indian races. &ldquo;Its principles are not
difficult to understand, for they plainly keep up the arrangements of
the living world. The dead ancestor, now passed into a deity, simply
goes on protecting his own family, and receiving suit and service from
them as of old; the dead chief still watches over his own tribe, still
holds his authority by helping friends and harming enemies; still
rewards the right and sharply punishes the wrong.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3378src" href="#xd21e3378" name="xd21e3378src">1</a>
It is in fact the earliest attempt of the savage to realize the
problems of human existence, as the theology of the Vedas or Olympus is
the explanation which the youth of the world offers of physical
phenomena. The latter is primitive physics, the former primitive
biology, and it marks a stage in the growth of anthropomorphism when
the worship of unseen spirits in general passes to that of unseen
spirits in particular.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Among the Aryans and Dr&acirc;vidians.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is admitted on all sides that this form of worship
was general among the Aryan nations;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3386src" href="#xd21e3386" name="xd21e3386src">2</a> but it is a
mistake to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>suppose, as is too often done, that the worship
was peculiar to them. That such was not the case can be proved by
numerous examples drawn from the practices of aboriginal tribes in
India, who have lived hitherto in such complete isolation, that the
worship can hardly be due to imitation of the customs of their more
civilized neighbours.</p>
<p>Thus, on the tenth day after a death in the family, the Ghasiyas of
Mirzapur, about the most degraded of the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes, feed
the brotherhood, and at the door of the cook-house spread flour or
ashes a cubit square on the ground. They light a lamp there and cover
both the square and the light with a basket. Then the son of the dead
man goes a little distance in the direction in which the corpse had
been carried out, and calls out his name loudly two or three times. He
invites him to come and sit on the shrine which his descendants have
prepared for him, and to consume the offerings which they are ready to
present. It is said that if the deceased died in any ordinary way and
not by the attack of a Bh&ucirc;t, he often calls from the burying
ground and says, &ldquo;I am coming!&rdquo; After calling his
father&rsquo;s spirit two or three times, the son returns to the house
and examines the flour or ashes, and if the deceased did not die by the
attack of a Bh&ucirc;t, the mark of his spirit is found on the flour or
ashes in the shape of the footprint of a rat or a weasel. When this is
observed, the son takes a white fowl and sacrifices it with a knife
near the cook-house, calling to the spirit of his
father&mdash;&ldquo;Come and accept the offering which is ready for
you!&rdquo; Some of them strangle the fowl with their hands, and before
killing it sprinkle a little grain before it, saying&mdash;&ldquo;If
you are really the spirit of my father, you will accept the
grain!&rdquo; Then he goes on to his father&rsquo;s
spirit&mdash;&ldquo;Accept the offering, sit in the corner and bless
your offspring!&rdquo; If the fowl eats the grain, there is great
rejoicing, as it implies that the spirit has quietly taken up its
residence in the house. If the fowl does not eat, it is supposed that
some sorcerer or enemy has detained the spirit with the ultimate object
of releasing it some time or other on its own family, with whom it is
presumably displeased <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href=
"#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>because they have taken no care to
propitiate it. If the soul does not answer from the burial ground, or
if there is no mark on the square of ashes, it is assumed that he has
fallen into the hands of some Bh&ucirc;t or Pret, who has shut him up
in the hollow stalk of a bamboo, or buried him in the earth; in any
case there is a risk that he may return, and the rite is still
performed as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>Among the Kharw&acirc;rs the holiest part of the house is the south
room, where it is supposed that the Devat&acirc; pitri or sainted dead
reside. They worship the spirits of the dead in the month of
S&acirc;wan (August) near the house-fire. The house-master offers up
one or two black fowls and some cakes and makes a burnt offering with
butter and molasses. Then he calls out&mdash;&ldquo;Whatever ghosts of
the holy dead or evil spirits may be in my family, accept this offering
and keep the field and house free from trouble!&rdquo; Many of the
Kharw&acirc;rs are now coming more completely under Br&acirc;hmanical
influence, and these worship the Pitri at weddings in the courtyard.
The house-master offers some balls of rice boiled in milk, and a
Br&acirc;hman standing by mutters some texts. They are now so advanced
as to do the annual service for the repose of the sainted spirits at
the Pitripaksha or fortnight of the dead in the month of Ku&acirc;r
(August).</p>
<p>The other Dr&acirc;vidian tribes follow similar customs. Thus, the
Korwas worship their dead relations in February with an offering of
goats, which is done by the eldest son of the dead man in the family
cook-house. Their ancestors are said not to appear in the flesh after
death, but to show themselves in dreams if they are dissatisfied with
the arrangements made for their comfort. On the day on which they are
expected to appear the householder makes an offering of cakes to them
in the family kitchen. The Pat&acirc;ris think that the dead
occasionally attend when worship is being done to them. At other times
they remain in the sky or wander about the mountains. Sometimes they
call in the night to their descendants and say&mdash;&ldquo;Worship us!
Give us food and drink!&rdquo; If they are not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>propitiated they give trouble and cause
sickness. The Kis&acirc;ns and Bhuiy&acirc;rs of Chota N&acirc;gpur
adore their ancestors, &ldquo;but they have no notion that the latter
are now spirits, or that there are spirits and ghosts, or a future
state, or anything.&rdquo; The Bhuiyas revere their ancestors under the
name of B&icirc;r or V&icirc;ra, &ldquo;hero,&rdquo; a term which is
elsewhere applied to ghosts of a specially malignant character. The
Khariyas put the ashes of their dead into an earthen pot and throw it
into a river. They afterwards set up in the vicinity slabs of stone as
a resting-place for them, and to these they make daily oblations. The
only worship performed by the Korwas of Chota N&acirc;gpur is to their
dead relatives, and the same is the case with other allied races, such
as the Bh&icirc;ls and Sant&acirc;ls.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Spirits Mortal.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most of these Dr&acirc;vidian tribes believe that like
themselves the spirits of the dead are mortal. What becomes of them
after a couple of generations no one can say. But when this period has
elapsed they are supposed to be finally disposed of some way or other,
and being no longer objects of fear to the survivors, their worship is
neglected, and attention is paid only to the more recent dead, whose
powers of mischief still continue. The Gonds go further and propitiate
for only one year the spirits of their departed friends, and this is
done even if they have been persons of no note during their lifetime;
but with worthies of the tribe the case is different, and if one of
them, for example, has founded a village or been its headman or priest,
then he is treated as a god for years, and a small shrine of earth is
erected to his memory, at which sacrifices are annually
offered.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3409src" href="#xd21e3409" name=
"xd21e3409src">4</a> It is said that the Ju&acirc;ngs, who until quite
recently used to dress in garments of leaves, are the only one of these
tribes who do not practise this form of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>worship.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3414src" href="#xd21e3414" name="xd21e3414src">5</a>
But these races are particularly reticent about their beliefs and
usages, and it is more than probable that further inquiry will show
that they are not peculiar in this respect.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Ancestors Re-born in Children.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among many races, again, there is a common belief that
the father or grandfather is re-born in one of his descendants. The
modern reader is familiar with examples of such beliefs in Mr. Du
Maurier&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peter Ibbetson,&rdquo; and Mr. Rider
Haggard&rsquo;s &ldquo;She.&rdquo; Manu expresses this belief when he
writes&mdash;&ldquo;The husband after conception by his wife, becomes
an embryo and is born again of her; for that is the wifehood of a wife,
that he is born again by her.&rdquo; The feeling that children are
really the ancestors re-born is obviously based on the principle of
hereditary resemblance. Hence the general feeling in favour of calling
a child by the name of the grandfather or grandmother, which is about
as far as the rustic goes in recognizing the ascending line. The Konkan
Kunbis, and even Br&acirc;hmans, believe that the dead ancestors
sometimes appear in children. Among Gujar&acirc;t Musalm&acirc;ns the
nurse, if a child is peevish, says, &ldquo;Its kind has come upon its
head.&rdquo; The same idea is found among the Kh&acirc;ndhs. Among the
Laplanders of Europe an ancestral spirit tells the mother that he has
come into the child, and directs her to call it after his
name.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3425src" href="#xd21e3425" name=
"xd21e3425src">6</a> Another variant of the same belief is that common
among some of the Dr&acirc;vidian races that the ancestor is revived in
a calf, which is in consequence well fed and treated with particular
respect.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Sr&acirc;ddha.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ordinary worship of ancestors among
Br&acirc;hmanized Hindu races has been so often described in well-known
books as to need little further illustration.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3436src" href="#xd21e3436" name="xd21e3436src">7</a> The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>spirits of departed ancestors attend upon the
Br&acirc;hmans invited to the ceremony of the Sr&acirc;ddha,
&ldquo;hovering round them like pure spirits, and sitting by them when
they are seated.&rdquo; &ldquo;An offering to the gods is to be made at
the beginning and end of the Sr&acirc;ddha; it must not begin and end
with an offering to ancestors, for he who begins and ends it with an
offering to the Pitri quickly perishes with his progeny.&rdquo; The
belief is common to many races that the spirits of the dead assemble to
partake of the food provided by the piety of their relations on earth.
Alcinous addressing the Ph&aelig;acians tells them&mdash;&ldquo;For
ever heretofore the gods appear manifest among us, whensoever we offer
glorious hecatombs, and they feast at our side sitting by the same
board.&rdquo; And the old Prussians used to prepare a meal, to which,
standing at the door, they invited the soul of the deceased.
&ldquo;When the meal was over the priest took a broom and swept the
souls out of the house, saying&mdash;&lsquo;Dear souls! ye have eaten
and drunk. Go forth! go forth!&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3441src" href="#xd21e3441" name="xd21e3441src">8</a></p>
<p>The place where the oblation is to be made is to be sequestered,
facing the south, the land of departed spirits, and smeared with
cow-dung. The use of this substance is easily to be accounted for,
without following the remarkable explanation of a modern writer, who
connects it with the dropping of the Aurora.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3446src" href="#xd21e3446" name="xd21e3446src">9</a> &ldquo;The
divine manes are always pleased with an oblation in empty glades,
naturally clean, on the banks of rivers, and in solitary spots.&rdquo;
The ceremony is to be performed by the eldest son, which furnishes the
Hindu with the well-known argument for marriage and the procreation of
male issue. We have seen that the Dr&acirc;vidians also regard the rite
as merely domestic and to be performed by the house-master.</p>
<p>The orthodox Hindu, besides the usual Sr&acirc;ddha, in connection
with his daily worship, offers the Tarpana or water oblation to the
sainted dead. The object of the annual Sr&acirc;ddha is, as is well
known, to accelerate the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href=
"#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>progress (<i>gati</i>) of the soul
through the various stages of bliss, known as S&acirc;lokya,
S&acirc;m&icirc;pya and S&acirc;r&ucirc;pya, and by its performance at
Gaya the wearied soul passes into Vaikuntha, or the paradise of
Vishnu.</p>
<p>Hindus do not allow their sons to bathe during the fortnight sacred
to the manes, as they believe that the dirt produced by bathing,
shaving, and washing the apparel will reach and annoy the sainted dead.
The story goes that R&acirc;ja Karana made a vow that he would not
touch food until he had given a maund and a quarter (about one hundred
pounds) of gold daily to Br&acirc;hmans. When he died he went to
heaven, and was there given a palace of gold to dwell in, and gold for
his food and drink, as this was all he had given away in charity during
his mortal life. So in his distress he asked to be allowed to return to
earth for fifteen days. His prayer was granted, and warned by sad
experience he occupied himself during his time of grace in giving
nothing but food in charity, being so busy that he neglected to bathe,
shave, or wash his clothes, and thus he became an example to succeeding
generations.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3458src" href="#xd21e3458"

<h3 class="main">Degradation of Ancestor-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The worship which has been thus described easily
passes into other and grosser forms. Thus, in the family of the
G&acirc;ikw&acirc;rs of Baroda, when they worship Mah&acirc;deva they
think of the greatest of this line of princes. The temple contains a
rudely-executed portrait of Kh&acirc;nd&ecirc; R&acirc;o, the shrine to
the left the bed, garments, and phial of Ganges water, which
commemorate his mother, Chimn&acirc;b&acirc;&icirc;. Govind R&acirc;o

id="xd21e3466src" href="#xd21e3466" name="xd21e3466src">11</a></p>
<p>In Central India R&acirc;jputs wear the figure of a distinguished
ancestor or relation engraved in gold or silver. This image, usually
that of a warrior on horseback, is sometimes worshipped, but its chief
utility is as a charm to keep off ghosts and evil spirits.<a class=

<p>The aboriginal Bhuiyas of Chota N&acirc;gpur, &ldquo;after disposing
of their dead, perform a ceremony which is supposed to bring back to
the house the spirit of the deceased, henceforth an object of household
worship. A vessel filled with rice and flour is placed for the time on
the tomb, and when brought back the mark of a fowl&rsquo;s foot is
found at the bottom of the vessel, and this indicates that the spirit
of the deceased has returned.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3477src" href="#xd21e3477" name="xd21e3477src">13</a> This is, as
we have seen, common to many of the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes, and we
shall meet instances of similar practices when we consider the
malignant variety of ghosts.</p>
<p>A curious example of the popular form of ancestor-worship is given
by General Sleeman:&mdash;&ldquo;R&acirc;ma Chandra, the Pandit, said
that villages which had been held by old Gond proprietors were more
liable than others to visitation from local ghosts, that it was easy to
say what village was or was not haunted, but often exceedingly
difficult to say to whom the ghost belonged. This once discovered, the
nearest surviving relation was, of course, expected to take steps to
put him to rest. But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is wrong to suppose
that the ghost of an old proprietor must be always doing mischief. He
is often the best friend of the cultivators, and of the present
proprietor too, if he treats him with proper respect; for he will not
allow the people of any other village to encroach upon the boundaries
with impunity, and they will be saved all expense and annoyance of a
reference to the judicial tribunals for the settlement of boundary
disputes. It will not cost much to conciliate these spirits, and the
money is generally well laid out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He instances a case of a family of village proprietors, &ldquo;who
had for several generations insisted at every new settlement upon
having the name of the spirit of the old proprietor inserted in the
lease instead of their own, and thereby secured his good graces on all
occasions.&rdquo; &ldquo;A cultivator who trespassed on land believed
to be in charge of such a spirit had his son bitten by a snake, and his
two oxen were seized with the murrain. In terror he went off to the
village temple, confessed his sin, and vowed to restore not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>only the half-acre of land, but to build a very
handsome temple on the spot as a perpetual sign of his repentance. The
boy and the bullocks all then recovered, the shrine was built, and is,
I believe, still to be seen as a boundary mark.&rdquo;<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From this family worship of deceased relations, the
transition to the special worship of persons of high local reputation
in life, or who have died in some remarkable way, is easy. The
intermediate links are the S&acirc;dhu and the Sat&icirc;, and the
worship finally culminates in a creed like that of the Jainas, who
worship a pantheon of deified saints, that of the Ling&acirc;yat
worship of Siva incarnated as Chambas&acirc;pa, or the godlike weaver
Kab&icirc;r of the Kab&icirc;rpanthis. The lowest phase of all is the
worship by the Halbas of Central India of a pantheon of glorified
distillers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3494src" href="#xd21e3494" name=

<h3 class="main">The S&acirc;dhu.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The S&acirc;dhu is a saint who is regarded as
&ldquo;the great power of God,&rdquo; the name meaning &ldquo;he that
is eminent in virtue.&rdquo; He is a visible manifestation of the
divine energy acquired by his piety and self-devotion. We shall meet
later on instances of deified holy men of this class. Meanwhile, it may
be noted, we see around us the constant development of the cultus in
all its successive stages. Thus, in Ber&acirc;r at Askot the saint is
still alive; at Wadnera he died nearly a century ago, and his
descendants live on the offerings made by the pious; at Jalg&acirc;nw a
crazy vagabond was canonized on grounds which strict people consider
quite insufficient. There is, of course, among the disciples and
descendants of these local saints a constant competition going on for
the honour of canonization, which once secured, the shrine may become a
very valuable source of income and reputation. But the indiscriminate
and ill-regulated deification of mortals <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>is one of the main
causes of the weakness of modern Hinduism, because, by a process of
abscission, the formation of multitudinous sects, which take their
titles and special forms of belief from the saint whose disciples they
profess to be, is promoted and encouraged. Thus, as has been well
remarked, Hinduism lies in urgent need of a Pope or acknowledged
orthodox head, &ldquo;to control its wonderful elasticity and
receptivity, to keep up the standard of deities and saints, and
generally to prevent superstitions running wild into a tangled jungle
of polytheism.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3504src" href=
"#xd21e3504" name="xd21e3504src">16</a></p>
<p>It would be out of place to give here any of the details of the
numerous sects which have been founded in this way to commemorate the
life and teaching of some eminent saint. The remarkable point about
this movement is that the leaders of these sects are not always or even
constantly drawn from the priestly classes. Thus the Charand&acirc;sis,
who are Krishna worshippers, take their name from Charan D&acirc;s, a
Dh&ucirc;sar, who are usually classed as Banyas, but claim to be
Br&acirc;hmans; Jhambaj&icirc;, the founder of the Bishnois, was a
R&acirc;jput; Kab&icirc;r, whoever he may have been, was brought up by
a family of Muhammadan weavers at Benares; N&acirc;mdeo was a cotton
carder; R&acirc;&ecirc; D&acirc;s is said to have been a Cham&acirc;r;
D&acirc;du was a cotton cleaner; many of them are half Muhammadans, as
the Chhaju-panthis and Shamsis. It is difficult to estimate highly
enough the result of this feeling of toleration and catholicism on the
progress of modern Hinduism.</p>

<p class="first">These saints have wrested from the reluctant gods by
sheer piety and relentless austerities, a portion of the divine
thaumaturgic power, which exudes after their death from the places
where their bodies are laid. This is the case with the shrines of both
Hindu and Musalm&acirc;n saints. Many instances of this will be found
in succeeding pages. Thus at Chun&acirc;r there is a famous shrine in
honour of Sh&acirc;h Q&acirc;sim <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185"
href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>Sulaim&acirc;ni,<a class=

"xd21e3517src">17</a> a local saint whose opinions were so displeasing
to Akbar that he imprisoned him here till his death in 1614
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> His cap and turban are still shown at his
tomb, and these, when gently rubbed by one of his disciples, pour out a
divine influence through the assembled multitude of votaries, many of
whom are Hindus. This holy influence extends even to the animal
kingdom. Thus the tomb of the saint Nirgan Sh&acirc;h at Sarauli in the
Bareilly District abounds in scorpions, which bite no one through the
virtue of the saint.</p>
<p>Hindu saints of the same class are so directly imbued with the
divine afflatus that they need not the purifying influence of fire, and
are buried, not cremated. Their Sam&acirc;dhi or final resting-place is
usually represented by a pile of earth, or a tomb or tumulus of a
conical or circular form. Others, again, like some of the
Gus&acirc;&icirc;ns, are after death enclosed in a box of stone and
consigned to the waters of the Ganges. These shrines are generally
occupied by a disciple or actual descendant of the saint, and there
vows and prayers are made and offerings presented.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Sat&icirc;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next link between ancestor-worship and that of
special deceased worthies is seen in the Sat&icirc;, or &ldquo;faithful
wife,&rdquo; who, before the practice was prohibited by our Government,
was bound to bear her deceased lord company to the world of spirits for
his consolation and service. The rite seems to have at one time
prevailed throughout the Aryan world.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3530src" href="#xd21e3530" name="xd21e3530src">18</a> It
undoubtedly prevailed in Slavonic lands,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3533src" href="#xd21e3533" name="xd21e3533src">19</a> and there
are even traces of it in Greece. Evadne is said to have burnt herself
with the body of her husband, Capaneus, and Oenone, according to one
account, leaped into the pyre on which the body of Paris was being
cremated. There are indications that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>the rite prevailed
among the Dr&acirc;vidian races, and it has been suggested that the
Hindus may have adopted it from them. Even to the present day among
some of the Bh&icirc;l tribes the wife of the dead man is carried along
with him on the bier to the burning ground, where she is laid down.
There she breaks her marriage necklace, and her ornaments are consumed
with the corpse of her husband, obviously a survival of the time when
she was actually burnt with him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3538src"
href="#xd21e3538" name="xd21e3538src">20</a></p>
<p>It is unnecessary here to enter into the controversy whether or not
the rite was based on a misinterpretation or perversion of one of the
sacred texts. That in old times the Sat&icirc; was treated with
exceptional honour is certain. In some places she went to the burning
ground richly dressed, scattering money and flowers, and calling out
the names of the deities, with music sounding and drums beating. In
some places she used to mark with her hands the gateways and walls of
the chief temple, and she sometimes marked in the same way a stone for
her descendants to worship, a practice to which reference will be made
later on. On such stones it was the custom to carve a representation of
her, and in many places a Chhatri, or ornamental cenotaph pavilion, was
erected in her honour. The small shrines in honour of the village
Sat&icirc; are found often in considerable numbers on the banks of
tanks all over Upper India. They are visited by women at marriages and
other festivals, and are periodically repaired and kept in order.
According to Mr. Ibbetson,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3543src" href=
"#xd21e3543" name="xd21e3543src">21</a> in the Delhi territory, these
shrines take the place of those dedicated to the Pitri, or sainted
dead. They often contain a representation in stone of the lord and his
faithful spouse, and one of his arms rests affectionately on her neck.
Sometimes, if he died in battle, he is mounted on his war steed and she
walks beside him; but her worshippers are not always careful in
identifying her shrine, and I have seen at least one undoubted Revenue
Survey pillar doing duty as a monument to some unnamed local divinity
of this class.</p>

<p>Among the warrior tribes of R&acirc;jput&acirc;na, the Sat&icirc;
shrine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>usually takes the form of a monument, on which
is carved the warrior on his charger, with his wife standing beside
him, and the images of the sun and the moon on either side,
emblematical of never-dying fame. Such places are the scene of many a
ghostly legend. As Col. Tod writes in his sentimental way<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3555src" href="#xd21e3555" name=
"xd21e3555src">22</a>&mdash;&ldquo;Among the altars on which have burnt
the beautiful and brave, the harpy or D&acirc;kin&icirc; takes up her
abode, and stalks forth to devour the heart of her victims.&rdquo; The
R&acirc;jput never enters these places of silence, but to perform
stated rites or anniversary offerings of flowers and water to the manes
of his ancestors. There is a peculiarly beautiful Sat&icirc; necropolis
at Udaypur, and the Sat&icirc; Burj, or tower at Mathura, erected in
honour of the queen of R&acirc;ja Bih&acirc;r Mal of Jaypur in 1570
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>, is one of the chief ornaments of the

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Sat&icirc; and the Pitri.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The connection between the special worship of the
Sat&icirc; and that of the Pitri or sainted dead will have been
remarked. In many places the Sat&icirc; represents the company of the
venerated ancestors and is regarded as the guardian mother of the
village, and in many of the rustic shrines of this class the same
connection with the Pitri is shown in another interesting way. The
snake is, as we shall see, regarded as a type of the household deity,
which is often one of the deified ancestors, and so, in the Sat&icirc;
shrine we often see a snake delineated in the act of rising out of the
masonry, as if it were the guardian mother snake arising to receive the
devotion of her descendants.</p>
<p>The Sat&icirc; having thus secured the honour of deification by her
sacrifice, is able to protect her worshippers and gratify their
desires. Some are even the subject of special honour, such as
Sakh&ucirc; B&acirc;&icirc;, who is worshipped at Akola.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3571src" href="#xd21e3571" name=
"xd21e3571src">24</a> Even the Dr&acirc;vidian Kaurs of Sarguja worship
a deified Sat&icirc;, another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188"
href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>link connecting the cultus
with the aboriginal races. She has a sacred grove, and every year a
fowl is sacrificed to her, and every third year a goat. Col.
Dalton<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3576src" href="#xd21e3576" name=
"xd21e3576src">25</a> observes that the Hindus who accompanied him were
intensely amused at the idea of offering fowls to a Sat&icirc;, who is
accustomed to the simpler bloodless tribute of milk, cakes, fruit and
flowers. This is the form of the offering at Jilmili, the Sat&icirc;
shrines belonging to the local R&acirc;ja. The curses of a dying
Sat&icirc; were greatly feared. Numerous instances of families ruined
in this way are told both in R&acirc;jput&acirc;na and in Nep&acirc;l,
the last places where the rite is occasionally performed.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3579src" href="#xd21e3579" name=
"xd21e3579src">26</a></p>
<p>The arrangements for the cremation varied in different places. In
Western India she sat in a specially built grass hut, and keeping her
husband&rsquo;s head in her lap, supported it with her right hand,
while she kindled the hut with a torch held in her left hand. Nowadays
in Nep&acirc;l the husband and the Sat&icirc; are made to lie side by
side on the pyre. The woman&rsquo;s right hand is put under the
husband&rsquo;s neck, and round her face are placed all kinds of
inflammable substances. Three long poles of undried wood are laid over
the bodies&mdash;one over the legs, the second over the chest, and the
third over the neck. Three men on either side press down the poles till
the woman is burnt to death. There have been cases in which the
wretched victim tried to escape, and was dragged back by force to her
death.</p>
<p>A curious modification of the practice of Sat&icirc;, which so far
has been traced only in R&acirc;jput&acirc;na, is what is known as
M&acirc; Sat&icirc;, or mother Sat&icirc;, where the mother immolates
herself with her dead child. Colonel Powlett<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3586src" href="#xd21e3586" name="xd21e3586src">27</a> remarks
that in inquiring about it one is often told that it is really
Mah&acirc; Sat&icirc;, or &ldquo;the great Sat&icirc;.&rdquo; He adds
that there can be no doubt that mother Sat&icirc; really prevails, but
was confined to the sandy and desert tract, where domestic affection is
said <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>to be stronger than elsewhere. &ldquo;In one
large remote village I found five monuments to Mother Sat&icirc;s, one
a Chhatri or pavilion of some pretensions. A R&acirc;jput lady from
Jaysalmer was on a visit to her father&rsquo;s family with her youngest
son. The boy was thrown when exercising his pony, dragged in the
stirrup and killed. His mother became Sat&icirc; with her son&rsquo;s
body, and probably her example, for she was a person of some rank, led
to the subsequent practice of M&acirc; Sat&icirc; in the same
district.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Modern Saints.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have already noticed some instances of the
canonization in modern times of saints and holy men. Of worthies of
this kind, who have received divine honours, the number is legion. This
deification of human beings is found in the very early
Br&acirc;hmanical literature. One of the most noteworthy ideas to be
found in the Br&acirc;hmanas is that the gods were merely mortal till
they conquered Death by their sacrifices. Death, alarmed, protested to
the gods, and it was then arranged that no one should become immortal
by the force of his piety without first offering his body to Death.
Manu declares that &ldquo;from his birth alone a Br&acirc;hman is
regarded as a divinity, even by the gods.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3596src" href="#xd21e3596" name="xd21e3596src">28</a> Modern
practice supports this by calling him Mah&acirc;-r&acirc;ja or

of the famous kings of old.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3599src" href=
"#xd21e3599" name="xd21e3599src">29</a> In the same way the Etruscans
had certain rites through which the souls of men could become gods and
were called <span lang="la">Dii Animales</span>, because they had once
been human souls. Quite in consonance with Indian practice they first
became Penates and Lares before they rose to the rank of the superior
deities.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3605src" href="#xd21e3605" name=

Meerut because he delivered a prophecy that a windmill belonging to a
certain Mr. Smith would soon cease to work. The fulfilment of his
prediction was considered ample evidence of his sanctity, and the
question was put beyond the possibility of doubt when, just before his
death, the holy man directed his disciples to remove him from an inn,
which immediately fell down. Another saint of the same place is said to
have given five years of his life to the notorious Begam Samru, who
died in 1836, in all the odour of sanctity.</p>

sufficient to convince the old chief that he could work other miracles,
and he prayed that through his means he might no longer be childless.
In due time he had an heir, who, according to the injunction of
B&ucirc;rhan, was styled, after his own tribe, Shaikh, whence the title

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have already given an instance of the second class
in Hardaul L&acirc;la, the cholera godling. Another example of the same
kind is that of Harshu P&acirc;nr&ecirc; or Harshu B&acirc;ba, the
local god of Chayanpur, near Sahsar&acirc;m in Bengal, whose worship is
now rapidly spreading over Northern India, and promises to become as
widely diffused as that of Hardaul himself. He was, according to the
current account, a Kanaujiya Br&acirc;hman, the family priest of
R&acirc;ja S&acirc;liv&acirc;hana of Chayanpur. The R&acirc;ja had two
queens, one of whom was jealous of the priest&rsquo;s influence. About
this time the priest built a fine house close to the palace, and one
night the R&acirc;ja and the R&acirc;n&icirc; saw a light from its
upper story gleaming aloft in the sky. The R&acirc;n&icirc; hinted to
the R&acirc;ja that the priest had designs of ousting his master from
the kingdom; so the R&acirc;ja had his house demolished and resumed the
lands which had been conferred upon him. The enraged Br&acirc;hman did
<i>dharn&acirc;</i>, in other words fasted till he died at the palace
gate. This tragical event occurred in 1427 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span>, and when they took his body for cremation at Benares,
they found Harshu standing in his wooden sandals on the steps of the
burning Gh&acirc;t. He then informed them <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>that he had become a
Brahm, or malignant Br&acirc;hman ghost. The R&acirc;ja&rsquo;s
daughter had been kind to the Br&acirc;hman in his misfortunes and he
blessed her, so that her family exists in prosperity to this day. But
the rest of his house was destroyed, and now only the gateway at which
the Br&acirc;hman died remains to commemorate the tragedy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3651src" href="#xd21e3651" name=
"xd21e3651src">32</a></p>
<p>Harshu is now worshipped as a Brahm with the fire sacrifice and
offerings of Br&acirc;hmanical cords and sweetmeats. If any one obtains
his desires through his intercession, he makes an offering of a golden
sacred cord and a silken waist-string, and feeds Br&acirc;hmans in his
honour. Harshu&rsquo;s speciality is exorcising evil spirits which
attack people and cause disease. Such spirits are usually of low caste
and cannot withstand the influence of this deified Br&acirc;hman.</p>

Harshu, is Ratan P&acirc;nr&ecirc;, who is venerated by the Kalhans

N&acirc;r&acirc;yan Sinh, ravished the daughter of Ratan
P&acirc;nr&ecirc;. He pleaded in vain to the wicked R&acirc;ja for
reparation, and at last he and his wife starved themselves to death at
the gate of the fort. He too, like Harshu, spared a princess of the
R&acirc;ja&rsquo;s house, but he cursed the rest of his family with
ruin. After he died his ghost went to the river Sarj&ucirc; and claimed
her assistance in revenging himself on the R&acirc;ja. She at last
consented to help him, provided he could get the R&acirc;ja into his
power by inducing him to accept some present from him. So he went to
the R&acirc;ja&rsquo;s family priest and induced him to take from him a
sacred cord with which he was to invest the R&acirc;ja. When Achal
N&acirc;r&acirc;yan Sinh heard to whom he was indebted for the gift he
flung it away in terror. But soon after an angry wave rushed from the

<p class="first">There is a similar case among the Hayobans
R&acirc;jputs of Gh&acirc;zipur. In 1528 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
their R&acirc;ja Bhopat Deva, or perhaps one of his sons, seduced
Mahen&icirc;, a Br&acirc;hman girl, a relation of their family priest.
She burned herself to death, and in dying, imprecated the most fearful
curses on the Hayobans sept. In consequence of a succession of
disasters which followed, the tribe completely abandoned their family
settlement at Baliya, where the woman&rsquo;s tomb is worshipped to
this day. Even now none of the sept dares to enter the precincts of
their former home. In the same way, in the case of Harshu
P&acirc;nr&ecirc; no pilgrim will eat or drink near his tomb, as the
place is accursed through the murder of a Br&acirc;hman.<a class=

<p>There are numerous other cases of this deification of suicide
Br&acirc;hmans in Northern India. The forms in which they sought
vengeance by their death on their persecutors are diversified in the
extreme. There is a case of a Br&acirc;hman in the Part&acirc;bgarh
District who, when turned out of his land, to avenge himself, gathered
a heap of cow-dung in the centre of one of the fields and lay down on
it till he was devoured by worms. This happened sixty years ago, but
his fields still stand a waste of jungle grass in the midst of rich
cultivation, and neither Hindu nor Muhammadan dares to plough
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3679src" href="#xd21e3679" name=

<p>At the last census of the North-Western Provinces over four hundred
thousand people recorded themselves as worshippers of various forms of
the Brahm or malignant Br&acirc;hman ghost. Most of these are
R&acirc;jputs, who were probably the most violent oppressors of
Br&acirc;hmans in the olden days.</p>

<p class="first">Another instance of the same type may be given from
R&acirc;jput&acirc;na. Jaswant Sinh of M&acirc;rw&acirc;r had an
intrigue with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>the daughter of one of his chief officers.
&ldquo;But the avenging ghost of the Br&acirc;hman interposed between
him and his wishes; a dreadful struggle ensued, in which Jaswant lost
his senses, and no effort could banish the impression from his mind.
The ghost persecuted his fancy, and he was generally believed to be
possessed of a wicked spirit, which when exorcised was made to say he
would depart only on the sacrifice of a chief equal in dignity to
Jaswant. N&acirc;har Kh&acirc;n, &lsquo;the tiger lord,&rsquo; chief of
the Kump&acirc;wat clan, who led the van in all his battles,
immediately offered his head in expiation for his prince; and he had no
sooner expressed his loyal determination, than the holy man who
exorcised the spirit, caused it to descend into a vessel of water, and
having waved it round his head, they presented it to N&acirc;har
Kh&acirc;n, who drank it off, and Jaswant&rsquo;s senses were instantly
restored. This miraculous transfer of the ghost is implicitly believed
by every chief of R&acirc;jasth&acirc;n, by whom N&acirc;har

wife of an astrologer, who murdered him and his paramour. They both
became malignant ghosts, to whom numerous temples were erected. When
anyone is injured by the wicked or powerful, he has recourse to
Gang&acirc;n&acirc;th, who punishes the evil-doer. Of the same type is
Bholan&acirc;th, whose brother, Gy&acirc;n Chand, was one of the Almora

in the same way. From the Him&acirc;laya to Bombay, Datt&acirc;treya, a
saint in whom a part of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva was incarnate, is
worshipped by Vaishnavas as a partial manifestation of the deity, and
by Saivas as a distinguished authority on the Yoga philosophy. He has
temples both in Garhw&acirc;l and in the Konkan, like Par&acirc;sara
Rishi, the reputed author of the Vishnu Pur&acirc;na, who wished to
make a sacrifice to destroy the R&acirc;kshasas, but was dissuaded by
the saints, and then scattered the fire over the slope of the
Him&acirc;laya, where it blazes forth at the phases of the
moon.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3744src" href="#xd21e3744" name=
"xd21e3744src">42</a> In like fashion the records of the last census
have shown worshippers of the poets K&acirc;lid&acirc;sa and Tulasi
D&acirc;s, as in Bombay their great writers Dny&acirc;nadeva and
T&ucirc;kar&acirc;m are deified by the Mar&acirc;thas. Nearly seven
thousand people in the North-Western Provinces adore Vasishtha, the
famous Rishi, and many others N&acirc;rada Muni, who is a well-known
personage and generally acts as a sort of <i>Deus ex machin&acirc;</i>
in the folk-tales. On the whole in the North-Western Provinces over a
quarter million people recorded themselves as votaries of these deified
saints, devotees and teachers.</p>
<p>The same form of worship largely prevails in the Panj&acirc;b. Among
other worthies we find Sy&acirc;mji, a Chauh&acirc;n R&acirc;ja who is
said to have given his head to Krishna and Arjuna on condition that he
should be allowed to witness the fight between the Kauravas and
P&acirc;ndavas; Dhanwantari, the physician of the gods; Drona
Ach&acirc;rya, the teacher of military science to the heroes of the
great war. The Kumh&acirc;rs or potters worship Prajapati, the active
creator of the universe; and the K&acirc;yasth scribes adore
Chitragupta, who keeps the register <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

godlings deified bandits. Such is Gandak, the patron of the Magahiya
Doms, and Salhes, who is worshipped by the Doms and Dus&acirc;dhs of
Beh&acirc;r. He was a great hero and the first watchman. He fought a
famous battle with Ch&ucirc;har M&acirc;&icirc; of Moh&acirc;ma, and is
the subject of a popular epic in Tirh&ucirc;t. With his worship is
associated that of his brother Motir&acirc;m, another worthy of the
same kind.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3762src" href="#xd21e3762" name=

Gauraiya, a Dus&acirc;dh bandit chief, to which members of all castes
resort, the higher castes making offerings of meal, the outcastes
sacrificing a hog or several young pigs and pouring out libations of
spirits on the ground. But even here the primitive local cultus is in a
state of transition, as in the case of Salhes, who, according to some,
was the porter of Bh&icirc;m Sen.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3765src"

of the higher gods.</p>
<p>Another bandit godling is Mitthu Bh&ucirc;khiya, a freebooter,
worshipped by the Banj&acirc;ras or wandering carriers. He has a
special hut, in which no one may drink or sleep, and which is marked
with a white flag. The tribe always worship him before committing a
crime. They assemble together and an image of the famous tribal
Sat&icirc; is produced. Butter is put into a saucer, and in this a
light is placed, very broad at the bottom and tapering upwards. The
wick, standing erect, is lit, an appeal is made to the Sat&icirc; for
an omen, and those worshipping mention in a low tone to the godling
where they are going, and what they propose to do. The wick is then
carefully watched, and should it drop at all, the omen <span class=

R&acirc;ja L&acirc;khan. One story of him is that he came from Lucknow,
a legend based, of course, on the similarity of the name. But there can
be no reasonable doubt that he was really Lakhana Deva, the son of the
famous R&acirc;ja Jaychand of Kanauj, who is known in the popular
ballads as the Kanaujiya R&acirc;&ecirc;. There is an inscribed pillar

the Hindus against the Muhammadan invaders. All this being granted, it
is remarkable that he, a R&acirc;jput, and almost as much a stranger to

there he would find the idol. He did so, and, digging up the image,
which was of gold, cut it up and sold it. But his whole household came

&ldquo;At Sanoda there is a very beautiful little fortress or castle,

R&acirc;ja Chhattar S&acirc;l of Bundelkhand about 1725 <span class=

the castle had been completed, killed in an attack upon a town near

had a temple and a tank raised to him. I asked the people how he became
a god, and was told that some one who had been long suffering from
quartan ague went to the tomb one night and promised R&acirc;&ecirc;
Sinh, whose ashes lay under it, that if he could contrive to cure his
ague for him, he would during the rest of his life make offerings at
his shrine. After this he never had an attack and was very punctual in
his offerings. Others followed his example and with like success, till

<h3 class="main">The P&icirc;rs and Sayyids.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We now come to a more miscellaneous class&mdash;the
P&icirc;rs and Sayyids. Some of these we have encountered already. We
have also seen instances of some holy men who, like Paul and Silas at
Lystra, have been raised to the rank of deities. These saints are
usually of Muhammadan origin, but most of them are worshipped
indiscriminately both by Musalm&acirc;ns and low class Hindus. The word
P&icirc;r properly means &ldquo;an elder,&rdquo; but according to
S&ucirc;fi belief is the equivalent of Murshid, or &ldquo;religious
leader.&rdquo; Sayyid, an Arabic word meaning &ldquo;lord&rdquo; or
&ldquo;prince,&rdquo; is probably in many cases a corruption of
Shah&icirc;d, &ldquo;a martyr of the faith,&rdquo; because many of
these worthies owe their reputation to having lost their lives in the
early struggles between Isl&acirc;m and Hinduism. Mr. Ibbetson notes
that he has seen a shrine of some Sayyids in the J&acirc;landhar
District, who were said to have been Sikhs, who died in the front of
the battle. It took the form of a Muhammadan tomb, lying east and west,
surmounted by two small domes of Hindu shape with their openings to the
south. Under each, in the face of the tomb, was a niche to receive a
lamp.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3839src" href="#xd21e3839" name=
"xd21e3839src">50</a></p>
<p>This and many other instances of the same kind illustrate in an
admirable way the extreme receptivity of the popular belief. We have
here a body of saints, many of whom were deadly enemies of the Hindu
faith, who are now worshipped by Hindus. This is well put by Sir A.
Lyall&mdash;&ldquo;The &rsquo;Urs, or annual ceremony of these saints,
like the martyr&rsquo;s day of St. Edmund or St. Thomas of Canterbury,
has degenerated into much that is mere carnal traffic and pagan
idolatry, a scandal to the rigid Isl&acirc;mite. Yet, if he uplifts his
voice against such soul-destroying abuses, he may be hooted by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>loose-living Musalm&acirc;ns as a Wahh&acirc;bi
who denies the power of intercession, while the shopkeepers are no
better than Ephesian goldsmiths in crying down an inconvenient
religious reformer.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3846src" href=
"#xd21e3846" name="xd21e3846src">51</a> And the same writer illustrates
the fusion of the two creeds in their lower forms by the fact that the
holy Hindu now in the flesh at Askot has only recently taken over the
business, as it were, from a Muhammadan Faq&icirc;r, whose disciple he
was during his life, and now that the Faq&icirc;r is dead, Narsinh
B&acirc;wa presides over the annual veneration of his slippers.
Similarly at the Muharram celebration and at pilgrimages to tombs, like
those of Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n, a large number of the votaries are
Hindus. In many towns the maintenance of these Muhammadan festivals
mainly depends on the assistance of the Hindus, and it is only recently
that the unfortunate concurrence of these exhibitions with special
Hindu holidays has, it may be hoped only temporarily, interrupted the
tolerant and kindly intercourse between the followers of the rival
creeds.</p>
<p>In many of these shrines the actual or pretended relics of the
deceased worthy are exhibited. Under the shadow of the Fort of
Chun&acirc;r is the shrine of Sh&acirc;h Q&acirc;sim Sulaim&acirc;ni,
of whom mention has been already made. The guardian of the shrine shows
to pilgrims the turban of the saint, who was deified about three
hundred years ago, and the conical cap of his supposed preceptor, the
eminent P&icirc;r Jah&acirc;niya Jah&acirc;ngasht; but, as in many such
cases, the chronology is hopeless.</p>

leading saints&mdash;Bah&acirc;-ud-d&icirc;n Zikariya of Mult&acirc;n,
Sh&acirc;h Ruqa-i-&Acirc;lam Hazrat of Lucknow, Sh&acirc;h Shams
Tabr&icirc;z of Mult&acirc;n, Shaikh Jal&acirc;l Makhd&ucirc;m
Jah&acirc;niy&acirc;n Jah&acirc;ngasht of Uchcha in Mult&acirc;n, and
B&acirc;ba Shaikh Far&icirc;d-ud-d&icirc;n Shakkarganj of P&acirc;k
Patan. Another enumeration gives the Ch&acirc;r P&icirc;r or four great
saints as &rsquo;Ali and his successors in saintship&mdash;Khw&acirc;ja
Hasan Basri, Khw&acirc;ja Hab&icirc;b &rsquo;Ajmi, &rsquo;Abdul
W&acirc;hid. Another list of P&icirc;rs of Upper India gives their
names as Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n, P&icirc;r Hath&icirc;l&ecirc;,
sister&rsquo;s son of Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n, P&icirc;r Jal&icirc;l of
Lucknow, and P&icirc;r Muhammad of Jaunpur. It is, in fact, impossible
to find a generally recognized catalogue of these worthies, and modern
Isl&acirc;m is no less subject to periodical change than other
religions organized on a less rigid system.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Caste Saints.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The worship of the original saints of Isl&acirc;m has,
however, undergone a grievous degradation. We are familiar in Western
hagiology with the specialization of saints for certain purposes. St.
Agatha is invoked to cure sore breasts, St. Anthony against
inflammation, St. Blaise against bones sticking in the throat, St.
Martin for the itch, St. Valentine against epilepsy, and so on. So St.
Agatha presides over nurses, St. Catherine and St. Gregory over learned
men, St. Cecilia over musicians, St. Valentine over lovers, St.
Nicholas over thieves, while St. Thomas &agrave; Becket looks after
blind men, eunuchs, and sinners.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3869src"
href="#xd21e3869" name="xd21e3869src">54</a> So almost all the artizan
classes have each their special patron saint. The dyers venerate
P&icirc;r &rsquo;Ali Rangrez, the Loh&acirc;rs or blacksmiths, Hazrat
D&acirc;&ucirc;d, or the Lord David, because the Qur&acirc;n
says&mdash;&ldquo;We taught him the art of making coats of mail that
they might defend you from your suffering in warring with your
enemies.&rdquo; The Mehtars or sweepers have L&acirc;l P&icirc;r or
L&acirc;l <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>Beg, of whom something more will be said later
on. In the Panj&acirc;b Sadhua Bhagat is the saint of butchers, because
once when he was about to kill a goat, the animal threatened that he
would revenge himself in another life, and so he joined the sect of
S&acirc;dhs, who refrain from destroying animal life. The barbers
revere Sain Bhagat or Husain Bhagat. He is said to have been a resident
of Prat&acirc;ppura in the J&acirc;landhar District, and his
descendants were for some time family Gurus or preceptors of the
R&acirc;ja of Bandhogarh. One day he was so engaged in his devotions
that he forgot to shave the R&acirc;ja&rsquo;s head, but when he came
in fear and trembling to apologize, he found the R&acirc;ja shaved and
in his right mind. Then it was found that the deity himself had come
and officiated for him. So, N&acirc;mdeo, the Chh&icirc;pi or
cotton-printer, became a follower of R&acirc;manand, and is regarded as
the tribal saint.</p>

<h3 class="main">Domestic Worship of the P&icirc;r.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Muhammadan domestic worship is largely concerned with
the propitiation of the household P&icirc;r. In almost every house is a
dreaded spot where, as the Russian peasant keeps his holy image, is the
abode or corner of the P&icirc;r, and the owner erects a little shelf,
lights a lamp every Thursday night, and hangs up garlands of flowers.
Shaikh Saddu, of whom we shall see more later on, is the women&rsquo;s
favourite P&icirc;r, especially with those who wish to gain an undue
ascendency over their husbands. When a woman wishes to have a private
entertainment of her own, she pretends to be &ldquo;shadow
smitten,&rdquo; that is that the shadow of some P&icirc;r, usually
Shaikh Saddu, has fallen upon her, and her husband is bound to give an
entertainment, known as a Baithak or &ldquo;session,&rdquo; for the
purpose of exorcising him, to which no male is allowed admittance. At
these rites of the Bona Dea, it is believed that the P&icirc;r enters
the woman&rsquo;s head and that she becomes possessed, and in that
state of frenzy can answer any question put to her. All her female
neighbours, accordingly, assemble to have their fortunes told by the
P&icirc;r, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>and when they are satisfied they exorcise him
with music and singing.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Pachpiriyas.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But it is in the eastern districts of the
North-Western Provinces and Beh&acirc;r that the worship has reached
its most degraded form. No less than one million seven hundred thousand
persons at the last census, almost entirely in the Gorakhpur and
Benares Divisions, recorded themselves as Pachpiriyas or worshippers of
the P&acirc;nch P&icirc;r. It is impossible to get any consistent
account of these worthies, and the whole cultus has become imbedded in
a mass of the wildest legend and mythology.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3886src" href="#xd21e3886" name="xd21e3886src">55</a> According
to the census lists these five saints are, in the order of their
popularity&mdash;Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n, Buahna P&icirc;r,
Palih&acirc;r, Amin&acirc; Sat&icirc; and Hath&icirc;l&ecirc; or
Hath&icirc;la. In Benares, according to Mr. Greeven, there are no less
than five enumerations of the sacred quintette. One
gives&mdash;Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n, Amin&acirc; Sat&icirc;,
Suth&acirc;n, &rsquo;Ajab S&acirc;l&acirc;r and Palih&acirc;r; a

Suth&acirc;n, &rsquo;Ajab S&acirc;l&acirc;r and Buahna; a
third&mdash;Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n, Amin&acirc; Sat&icirc;, Buahna,
Bhairon and Band&ecirc;; a fourth&mdash;Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n,
Amin&acirc; Sat&icirc;, Palih&acirc;r, K&acirc;lik&acirc; and
Shahz&acirc;; a fifth&mdash;Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n, Suth&acirc;n,
&rsquo;Ajab S&acirc;l&acirc;r, Buahna and Bahl&acirc;no. Among these we
have the names of well-known Hindu gods, like Bhairon and
K&acirc;lik&acirc;, a form of K&acirc;l&icirc;. Among the actual
companions of Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n are, it is believed,
Hath&icirc;l&ecirc; P&icirc;r, who is said to have been his
sister&rsquo;s son, Miy&acirc;n Rajjab or Rajjab S&acirc;l&acirc;r, and
Sikandar Diw&acirc;na, the Buahna P&icirc;r, who are all buried at
Bahr&acirc;ich, and S&acirc;hu S&acirc;l&acirc;r, father of the martyr
prince, whose tomb is near B&acirc;rabanki.</p>
<p>In Beh&acirc;r, again, the five saints are Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n,
Hath&icirc;la, Parih&acirc;r, Sahj&acirc; M&acirc;&icirc; and
&rsquo;Ajab S&acirc;l&acirc;r, and with them are associated Amin&acirc;
Sat&icirc;, Langra T&acirc;r, who is represented by a piece of crooked
wire, and Sobarna T&icirc;r, the bank of the Sobarna river. Here we
reach an atmosphere of the crudest fetishism. A little further west

<h3 class="main">The P&acirc;nch P&icirc;r and the P&acirc;ndavas.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has often been remarked that the five
P&acirc;ndavas have strangely passed out of the national worship. At
the last census in the North-Western Provinces only four thousand
people gave them as their personal deities, and in the Panj&acirc;b
only one hundred acknowledged them. Now in the west the title of
P&acirc;nch P&icirc;r is sometimes given to five R&acirc;jput heroes,
R&acirc;mdeo, P&acirc;bu, Harbu, Mallin&acirc;th and
G&ucirc;ga,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3898src" href="#xd21e3898" name=
"xd21e3898src">56</a> and it is at least a plausible theory that the
five P&icirc;rs may have originally been the five P&acirc;ndu brothers,
whose worship has, in course of time, become degraded, been annexed by
the lower Musalm&acirc;ns, and again taken over by their menial Hindu
brethren.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the system of worship does not materially
differ from the cultus of the degraded indigenous godlings, such as
K&acirc;r&ecirc; G&ocirc;r&ecirc; Deo, B&ucirc;rh&ecirc; B&acirc;ba,
Jokhaiya, and their kindred. The priests of the faith are drawn from
the Daf&acirc;li or Musalm&acirc;n drummer caste, who go about from
house to house reciting the tale of Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n and his
martyrdom, with a number of wild legends which have in course of time
been adopted in connection with him. An iron bar wrapped in red cloth
and adorned with flowers represents Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n, which is
taken from door to door, drums are beaten and petty offerings of grain
collected from the villagers. Low caste Hindus, like P&acirc;sis and
Cham&acirc;rs, worship them in the form of five wooden pegs fixed in
the courtyard of the house. The Barw&acirc;rs, a degraded criminal
tribe in Oudh, build in their houses an altar in the shape of a tomb,
at which yearly in August the head of the family sacrifices in the name
of the P&icirc;rs a fowl and offers some thin cakes, which he makes
over to a Muhammadan beggar who goes about from house to house beating
a drum. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The whole worship centres round Gh&acirc;zi
Miy&acirc;n. His real name was Sayyid S&acirc;l&acirc;r Masaud, and he
was nephew of Sult&acirc;n Mahm&ucirc;d of Ghazni. He was born in 1015
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>, was leader of one of the early invasions
of Oudh, and is claimed as one of the first martyrs of Isl&acirc;m in
India. He was killed in battle with the Hindus of Bahr&acirc;ich in
1034 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> Close to the battle-field was a tank
with an image of the sun on its banks, a shrine sacred in the eyes of
all Hindus. Masaud, whenever he passed it, was wont to say that he
wished to have this spot for a dwelling-place, and would, if it so
pleased God, through the power of the spiritual sun, destroy the
worship of the material. He was, it is said, buried by some of his
followers in the place which he had chosen for his resting-place, and
tradition avers that his head rests on the image of the sun, the
worship of which he had given his life to destroy.</p>
<p>There is some reason to believe that this cultus of Masaud may have
merely succeeded to some local worship, such as that of the sun, and in
this connection it is significant that the great rite in honour of the
martyr is called the By&acirc;h or marriage of the saint, and this
would associate it with other emblematical marriages of the earth and
sun or sky which were intended to promote fertility.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3918src" href="#xd21e3918" name="xd21e3918src">57</a> Masaud,
again, is the type of youth and valour in military Isl&acirc;m, and to
the Hindu mind assumes the form of one of those godlike youths, such as
Krishna or D&ucirc;lha Deo, snatched away by an untimely and tragical
fate in the prime of boyish beauty. So, though he was a fanatical
devotee of Isl&acirc;m, his tomb is visited as much by Hindus as by
Muhammadans. Besides his regular shrine at Bahr&acirc;ich, he has
cenotaphs at various places, as at Gorakhpur and Bhadohi in the
Mirzapur District, where annual fairs are held in his honour. The
worship of Masaud, which is now discouraged by Muhammadan purists,
embodied, even in early times, so much idolatry and fetishism as to be
obnoxious to the puritanic party; it fell under the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>censure of the authorities, and Sikandar Lodi
interdicted the procession of his spear.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3925src" href="#xd21e3925" name="xd21e3925src">58</a> Nowadays at
his festivals a long spear or pole is paraded about, crowned at the top
with bushy hair, representing the head of the martyr, which, it is
said, kept rolling on the ground long after it was severed from the
trunk.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3928src" href="#xd21e3928" name=

<h3 class="main">Sakhi Sarwar.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sakhi Sarwar, or &ldquo;generous leader,&rdquo; the
title of a saint whose real name was Sayyid Ahmad, is hardly popular
beyond the Panj&acirc;b, where his followers are known as
Sult&acirc;nis, and are more than four hundred thousand in
number.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3936src" href="#xd21e3936" name=
"xd21e3936src">60</a> No one knows exactly when he lived; some place
him in the twelfth and others in the thirteenth century; but there are
other traditions which would bring him down to the sixteenth. Whatever
be the exact time of his birth and death, he was one of the class of
Muhammadan saints, like Bah&acirc;-ud-d&icirc;n and Shams Tabr&icirc;z,
who settled and practised austerities in the country about
Mult&acirc;n. Other names for him are L&acirc;khd&acirc;ta or
&ldquo;the giver of l&acirc;khs,&rdquo; L&acirc;lanw&acirc;la,
&ldquo;he of the rubies,&rdquo; and Rohi&acirc;nw&acirc;la, or
&ldquo;he of the Hills.&rdquo; His life, as we have it, is but a mass
of legends. He once cured a camel of a broken leg by riveting it
together. Miraculously, as so many of these saints do, he gave two sons
to one Gannu of Mult&acirc;n and married his daughter. The hill that
overlooks his tomb at Nig&acirc;ha in the Dera Gh&acirc;zi Kh&acirc;n
District, at the edge of the Sulaim&acirc;n mountains, is said to have
been infested by a fearful giant. This monster used at night to stand
on the hill-top and with a torch lure unwary travellers to their
destruction. Against him Sakhi Sarwar and his four companions waged
war, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>all except the saint were killed; and such was
the fall of the monster that the hill trembled to its base. Within an
enclosure are seen the tombs of the saint, his lady, B&icirc;b&icirc;
R&acirc;&ecirc;, and a Jinn who fell before the onset of the hero. To
the east is the apartment containing the stool and spinning-wheel of
M&acirc;&icirc; &rsquo;Aeshan, Sakhi Sarwar&rsquo;s mother. It is a
curious instance of the combination of the two rival faiths, so
constantly observable in this phase of the popular worship, that close
to the shrine of Sakhi Sarwar is a temple of Vishnu, a shrine of
B&acirc;ba N&acirc;nak, the founder of Sikhism, and an image of
Bhairon, who appears in the legends as the servant or messenger of the
saint. The tomb presents a curious mixture of Musalm&acirc;n and Hindu
architecture. It was recently destroyed by fire, and two rubies
presented by N&acirc;dir Sh&acirc;h, and some valuable jewels, the gift
of Sult&acirc;n Zam&acirc;n Sh&acirc;h, were destroyed or lost.</p>
<p>The Sult&acirc;ni sect, in large numbers, under the guidance of
conductors known as Bharai, make pilgrimages to the tomb. Near it are
two dead trees, said to have sprung from the pegs which were used to
tether Kakk&icirc;, the saint&rsquo;s mare. The walls are hung with
small pillows of various degrees of ornamentation. Persons who suffer
from ophthalmia vow gold or silver eyes for their recovery. They vow to
shave the hair of an expected child at the temple, and its weight in
gold or silver is presented to the saint. Some childless parents vow to
him their first child, and on its birth take it to the temple with a
cord round its neck. There are numbers of sacred pigeons attached to
the shrine, which are supported by an allowance realized from certain
dedicated villages. The marks of &rsquo;Ali&rsquo;s fingers and the
print of his foot are still shown to the devout in consideration of a
fee to the guardians, and a visit is considered peculiarly efficacious
for the cure of demoniacal possession, exhibiting itself in the form of
epilepsy or hysteria.</p>
<p>Besides the shrine at Nig&acirc;ha, there are numerous other shrines
of the saint, of which the most celebrated are those connected with the
annual fair at Dhonkal in Gujr&acirc;nw&acirc;la, the Jhanda fair at
Pesh&acirc;war, and the Kadmon fair at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>An&acirc;rkali, near
Lahore. At Dhonkal there is a magic well which was produced by the
saint, the water of which is much in request. At An&acirc;rkali a class
of musicians, called Dholis, take young children, who are presented at
the tomb, and dance about with them. In the neighbourhood of Delhi he
is not held in so much respect, but shrines in his honour are common,
vows and pilgrimages to him are frequent, and Br&acirc;hmans tie
threads on the wrists of their clients on a fixed day in his name.
Under the name of L&acirc;khd&acirc;ta he has become the patron deity
of athletes, and especially of wrestlers.</p>
<p>In the central districts of the Panj&acirc;b, his shrine, an
unpretending little edifice, is to be seen outside nearly every hamlet.
&ldquo;The shrine is a hollow plastered brick cube, eight or ten feet
in each direction, covered with a dome some ten or twelve feet high and
with low minarets or pillars at the four corners, and a doorway in
front, opening out generally on a plastered brick platform. Facing the
doorway inside are two or three niches for lamps, but otherwise the
shrine is perfectly empty. The saint is especially worshipped on
Thursdays, when the shrine is swept, and at night lamps are lit inside
it. The guardians of the shrine are Musalm&acirc;ns of the Bharai clan,
who go round on Thursdays beating drums and collecting offerings. These
offerings, which are generally in small change or small handfuls of
grain or cotton, are mainly presented by women. Another method of
pleasing the saint is by vowing a R&ocirc;t; the R&ocirc;t is made by
placing dough to the extent vowed on a hot piece of earth, where a fire
has been burning, and distributing it when it is baked. He is also
worshipped by sleeping on the ground instead of on a bed. Wrestling
matches are also held in his honour, and the offerings made to the
performers go towards keeping up the shrine at Nig&acirc;ha. A true
worshipper of Sult&acirc;n will not sell milk on Thursday; he will
consume it himself or give it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarwar is essentially a saint of the J&acirc;ts, and he is also
revered by G&ucirc;jars and Jh&icirc;nwars, and women even of the
Khatri and Br&acirc;hman castes adore him. He has, according to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>the last returns, over four hundred thousand
worshippers in the Panj&acirc;b, and eight thousand in the
North-Western Provinces.</p>

<h3 class="main">G&ucirc;ga P&icirc;r.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another noted local saint is G&ucirc;ga P&icirc;r,
also known as Z&acirc;hir P&icirc;r, &ldquo;the saint apparent,&rdquo;
or Z&acirc;hir D&icirc;w&acirc;n, &ldquo;the minister apparent,&rdquo;
or in the Panj&acirc;b as B&acirc;garw&acirc;la, as his grave is near
Dadrewa in Bik&acirc;ner, and he is said to have reigned over the
B&acirc;gar or great prairies of Northern R&acirc;jput&acirc;na.
Nothing is known for certain about him, and the tales told of him are
merely a mass of wild legends. According to some he flourished
somewhere about the middle of the twelfth century, when Indian
hagiolatry was at its zenith. Others say that he was a Chauh&acirc;n
R&acirc;jput, a contemporary of Prithiv&icirc; R&acirc;ja of Delhi,
while by another story he died with his forty-five sons and sixty
nephews opposing Mahm&ucirc;d of Ghazni. He is said to have been a
Hindu with the title of G&ucirc;ga B&icirc;r, or &ldquo;the
hero&rdquo;; and one account represents him to have become a convert to
Isl&acirc;m. &ldquo;He is said to have killed his two nephews and to
have been condemned by their mother to follow them below. He attempted
to do so, but the earth objected that he being a Hindu, she was quite
unable to receive him till he should be properly burnt. As he was
anxious to revisit his wife nightly, this did not suit him, and so he
became a Musalm&acirc;n, and her scruples being thus removed, the earth
swallowed him and his horse alive.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3958src" href="#xd21e3958" name="xd21e3958src">61</a> In another
and more degraded form of the legend current in Muzaffarnagar, he is
said to have jumped into a pile of cow-dung, where he disappeared, a
series of stories which remind us of the Curtius myth.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3964src" href="#xd21e3964" name=
"xd21e3964src">62</a></p>
<p>Another elaborate legend represents G&ucirc;ga to be the son of the
R&acirc;n&icirc; B&acirc;chhal, and fixes his birthplace at
Sirs&acirc;wa in the Sah&acirc;ranpur District. About the time of the
invasion of Mahm&ucirc;d of Ghazni, she married Vatsa, the R&acirc;ja
of B&acirc;gardesa, or the R&acirc;jput&acirc;na desert. By the
influence of that ubiquitous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>saint, Gorakhn&acirc;th, she
conceived in spite of the intrigues of her sister, and her child was
called G&ucirc;ga, because the saint gave to his mother, as a
preservative, a piece of gum resin known as G&ucirc;gal. His cousins
attacked him and tried to rob him of his kingdom, but G&ucirc;ga
defeated them and cut off their heads, which he presented to his
mother. She, in her anger, ordered him to go to the place where he had
sent her nephews; so he requested the earth to receive him into her
bosom, which she refused to do until he became a convert to
Isl&acirc;m. He then went to Mecca, and became a disciple of one Ratan
H&acirc;ji, and on his return the earth opened and received him, with
his famous black mare Jav&acirc;diy&acirc;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3971src" href="#xd21e3971" name="xd21e3971src">63</a></p>
<p>The mare has, of course, a story of her own. G&ucirc;ga had no
children, and lamenting this to his guardian deity, he received from
him two barley-corns, one of which he gave to his wife and the other to
his famous mare, which gave birth to his charger, hence called
Jav&acirc;diy&acirc; or &ldquo;barley-born.&rdquo; We find this
wonderful mare through the whole range of folk-lore, but the best
parallel to her is the famous mare of Gwri of the golden hair, and
Setanta in the Celtic tale.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3976src" href=
"#xd21e3976" name="xd21e3976src">64</a></p>
<p>From Scotland, too, we get a parallel to the magic birth:
&ldquo;Here are three grains for thee that thou shalt give thy wife
this very night, and three others to the dog, and these three to the
mare; and these three thou shalt plant behind thy house; and in their
own time thy wife will have three sons, the mare three foals, and the
dog three puppies, and there will grow three trees behind thy house;
and the trees will be a sign, when one of thy sons dies one of the
trees will wither.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3981src" href=
"#xd21e3981" name="xd21e3981src">65</a> It is needless to say that this
is a stock incident in folk-lore.</p>

that of Nara Sinha, the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu, and of
Gorakhn&acirc;th, the famous ascetic, whose disciple he is said to have
been. He is adored by Hindus and Muhammadans alike, and by all castes,
by R&acirc;jputs and J&acirc;ts, as well as by Cham&acirc;rs and
Ch&ucirc;hras. Even the Br&acirc;hman looks on him with respect.
&ldquo;Which is greater,&rdquo; says the proverb, &ldquo;R&acirc;ma or
G&ucirc;ga?&rdquo; and the reply is, &ldquo;Be who may the greater,
shall I get myself bitten by a snake?&rdquo; in other words,
&ldquo;Though R&acirc;ma may be the greater, between ourselves, I dare
not say so for fear of offending G&ucirc;ga.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is represented on horseback, with his mother trying to detain him
as he descends to the infernal regions. He holds as a mark of dignity a
long staff in his hands, and over him two snakes meet, one being coiled
round his staff. Both the Hindu and Muhammadan Faq&icirc;rs take the
offerings devoted to him, and carry his Chhar&icirc; or standard,
covered with peacocks&rsquo; feathers, from house to house in the month
of August. As is the case with godlings of this class all over India,
it is significant of the association of his worship with some early
non-Aryan beliefs that the village scavenger is considered to be
entitled to a share of the offerings presented at his shrine.</p>
<p>According to the last census G&ucirc;ga had thirty-five thousand
worshippers in the Panj&acirc;b and one hundred and twenty-three
thousand in the North-Western Provinces.</p>

J&acirc;t snake godling of M&acirc;rw&acirc;r. He is said to have lived
about 900 years ago. One day he noticed that a Br&acirc;hman&rsquo;s
cow was in the habit of going to a certain place in the jungle, where
milk fell from her udder into the hole of a snake. Teja agreed to
supply the snake daily with milk, and thus save the Br&acirc;hman from
loss. Once when he was preparing to visit his father-in-law, he forgot
the compact, and the snake <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href=

necessary that he should bite Teja. He stipulated for permission first
to visit his father-in-law, to which the snake agreed. Teja proceeded
on his journey, and on the way rescued the village cattle from a gang
of robbers, but was desperately wounded in the encounter. Mindful of
his promise, he with difficulty presented himself to the snake, who,
however, could find no spot to bite, as Teja had been so grievously
wounded by the robbers. Teja therefore put out his tongue, which the
snake bit, and so he died. He is now a protector against snake-bite,
and is represented as a man on horseback, while a snake is biting his

of sweets,&rdquo; so called because he was able miraculously to
transmute dust or salt into sugar, was born in 1173 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span>, and died in 1265. His tomb is at P&acirc;kpatan, and
he enjoys high consideration in Northern India. He was a disciple of
Qutb-ud-d&icirc;n Bakhty&acirc;r K&acirc;ki, who again sat at the feet
of Mu&icirc;n-ud-d&icirc;n Chishti of Ajmer, also a great name to swear
by. Far&icirc;d&rsquo;s most distinguished disciple was
Niz&acirc;m-ud-d&icirc;n Auliya, who has a lovely tomb at
Ghay&acirc;spur, near Delhi. Far&icirc;d was very closely associated
with B&acirc;ba N&acirc;nak, and much of the doctrine of early Sikhism
seems to have been based on his teaching. He is said to have possessed
the Dast-i-ghaib, or &ldquo;hidden hand,&rdquo; a sort of magic bag
which gave him anything he wished, which is like the wishing hat and
inexhaustible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=

but he answered in the famous proverb&mdash;<i lang=
"hi-latn">Delh&icirc; d&ucirc;r ast</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Delhi is far
away,&rdquo; the Oriental equivalent to Rob Roy&rsquo;s &ldquo;It is a
far cry to Lochow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Musalm&acirc;n Thags looked on him as the founder of their
system, and used to make pilgrimages to his tomb. He is believed to
have been connected with the Assassins or disciples of the Old Man of
the Mountain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4032src" href="#xd21e4032"

Faq&icirc;rs.</p>
<p>Besides his shrine at P&acirc;kpatan he has another famous
Darg&acirc;h at Shaikhsir in Bik&acirc;ner, which is called after him,

W&acirc;rdha District of the Central Provinces.</p>
<p>The zeolitic concretions of the Gir&acirc;r hill are accounted for
as the petrified cocoanuts and other articles of merchandise belonging
to two travelling dealers who mocked the saint, on which he turned
their whole stock-in-trade into stones as a punishment. They implored
his pardon, and he created a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href=

<p>In the Western districts of the North-Western Provinces the
first-fruits of the sugar-cane crop are dedicated to him.</p>
<p>He was a thrifty saint, and for the last thirty years of his life he
supported himself by holding to his stomach wooden cakes and fruits

<h3 class="main">Minor Saints.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the minor saints the number is legion, and only a
few instances can be given. At Makanpur in the Cawnpur District is the
tomb of Zinda Sh&acirc;h Mad&acirc;r, who gives his name to the class
of Musalm&acirc;n Faq&icirc;rs, known as Mad&acirc;ri. He is said to
have been a native of Halab or Aleppo, and to have come to this place
in 1415 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, when he expelled a famous demon
named Makan Deo, after whom the place was named. Low class Hindus and
Musalm&acirc;ns worship him because he is supposed to save them from
snakes and scorpions, and the Kah&acirc;r bearers, as they go through
jungle at night, call out <i>Dam Mad&acirc;r!</i> The saint is said to
have had the power of restraining his breath, whence his name. In the
holy of holies of his shrine no woman is allowed to enter, no lights
are lighted, no hymns are chanted and no food is cooked.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Abdul Q&acirc;dir Jil&acirc;ni, who is said to take his name
from Jil, a village near B&acirc;ghd&acirc;d, is another noted saint.
He is also known as P&icirc;r-i-Dastg&icirc;r, P&icirc;r-i-&rsquo;Azam,
Ghaus-ul-&rsquo;Azam, and was born in 1078 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span>, and died at B&acirc;ghd&acirc;d. Some say that he is
identical with M&icirc;r&acirc;n S&acirc;hib, who is worshipped all
over Northern India. He is said to have been a magician, and to have
subdued to his service a Jinn named Zain Kh&acirc;n, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>whom
he treated with great cruelty. One day the Jinn surprised his master in
a state of uncleanness and slew him, but even then he was unable to
escape from the influence of this arch-magician, who rules him in the
world of spirits. M&icirc;r&acirc;n S&acirc;hib is said to be buried at
Ajmer, but he has Darg&acirc;hs at Amroha, in the
Mor&acirc;d&acirc;b&acirc;d District, at Benares and at B&ucirc;ndi. By
another account the tomb at Amroha is that of Shaikh Saddu or
Sadr-ud-d&icirc;n, who was once a crier of the mosque, and near his are
pointed out the tombs of his mother Gh&acirc;ziy&acirc; or As&ecirc;
and of Zain Kh&acirc;n, the Jinn. The saint of Jalesar, Hazrat
P&icirc;r Zari, is also known as M&icirc;r&acirc;n S&acirc;hib, and he
is by some identified with the Amroha worthy. In Karn&acirc;l he is
said to have led the Sayyid army against the R&acirc;ja of Tharwa, and
had his head carried off by a cannon ball during the battle. He did not
mind this, and went on fighting. Then a woman in one of the
R&acirc;ja&rsquo;s villages said&mdash;&ldquo;Who is fighting without
his head?&rdquo; upon which the body said&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Haq!
Haq!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord! the Lord!&rdquo; and fell down dead,
calling out&mdash;&ldquo;What? Are not these villages upside down
yet?&rdquo; upon which every village in the R&acirc;ja&rsquo;s
territory was turned upside down and everyone killed except a
Br&acirc;hman girl, the paramour of the R&acirc;ja. Their ruins remain
to authenticate the story. Now the saint and his sister&rsquo;s son,
Sayyid Kab&icirc;r, are jointly worshipped. We shall meet this headless
hero again in the case of the D&ucirc;nd, and it will be remembered
that a similar legend is told of Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n.</p>

<h3 class="main">Villages Overturned.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of these villages which were overturned by a curse we
have many examples all over the country. The ruins at Bakhira Dih in
Basti are said to have been a great city which was overthrown because a
R&acirc;ja seduced a Br&acirc;hman girl. At Batesar in Agra is the
Aundha Khera, which records a similar catastrophe. So B&acirc;ngarmau
in Un&acirc;o is called the Lauta Shahr or &ldquo;overthrown
city,&rdquo; because M&icirc;r&acirc;n S&acirc;hib destroyed it to
punish the curiosity of the R&acirc;ja <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>who wanted to know
why the robes of the saint which a washerman was washing gave forth a
divine perfume. So the town of K&acirc;ko was overwhelmed by the saint
B&icirc;b&icirc; Kam&acirc;lo because the Buddhist R&acirc;ja gave her
a dish cooked of the flesh of rats, which came to life when she touched
them. At Besnagar in Bhop&acirc;l the king and his subjects clung to a
heavenly chariot and were carried to the skies and their city was
overthrown, and the saint Qutb Sh&acirc;h overturned the city of Sunit
because the R&acirc;ja used to kill a child daily to cure an ulcer with
which he was afflicted.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4087src" href=
"#xd21e4087" name="xd21e4087src">74</a></p>
<p>Ab&ucirc; &rsquo;Ali Qalandar is hardly known beyond the
Panj&acirc;b. He came from Persia and died at P&acirc;nipat in 1324
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> He is usually known as B&ucirc; &rsquo;Ali
Qalandar, and it is said that he used to ride about on a wall. He
prayed so constantly that it was laborious to get water for his
ablutions each time; so he stood in the Jumn&acirc;, which then ran
past the town. After standing there seven years the fishes had gnawed
his legs and he was so stiff that he could hardly move, so he asked the
Jumn&acirc; to step back seven paces. She, in her hurry to oblige the
saint, went back seven Kos or ten miles, and there she is now.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4095src" href="#xd21e4095" name=
"xd21e4095src">75</a></p>
<p>Many other saints are said to have had similar power over rivers. So
recently as 1865 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, a miraculous bridge of
sand was built over the Jumn&acirc; at Karn&acirc;l by the prayer of a
Faq&icirc;r, of such rare virtue that lepers passing over and bathing
at both ends were cured; but the people say that the bridge had got
lost when they came there.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4103src" href=
"#xd21e4103" name="xd21e4103src">76</a> It was only the prayers of the
saint Far&icirc;d-ud-din Shakkarganj which stopped the westward
movement of the Satlaj, and the intercession of a holy Rishi changed
the course of the river at B&acirc;gheswar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4106src" href="#xd21e4106" name="xd21e4106src">77</a></p>
<p>B&ucirc; &rsquo;Ali gave the P&acirc;nipat people a charm which
dispelled all the flies from the town, but they grumbled and said that
they rather liked flies; so he brought them back a thousandfold. He was
buried first at Karn&acirc;l, but the P&acirc;nipat people <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>claimed his body, and opened his grave,
whereupon he sat up and looked at them till they became ashamed. They
then took away some bricks for the foundation of a shrine; but when
they got to P&acirc;nipat and opened the box, they found his body in
it; so he is now buried in both places, and there is a shrine erected
over the place where he used to ride on the wall.</p>

<p class="first">Shaikh Sadd&ucirc; has been mentioned in another
connection. His visitations cause melancholy and hypochondria. He is
exorcised by the distribution of sweets to the poor and the sacrifice
of a black goat. He once found a magic lamp, like that of

<p>The list of these worthies is immense. We can only mention in

Bayaz&icirc;d, who kindled a lamp which lighted the world for one
hundred and twenty miles, and thus drove the Jinn from Chatg&acirc;nw
in Bengal, where he is worshipped; Shaikh Kab&icirc;r, known as
B&acirc;la P&icirc;r, the son of Sh&acirc;h Q&acirc;sim Sulaim&acirc;ni
of Chun&acirc;r, whose shrine is at Kanauj; Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus of
Gw&acirc;liy&acirc;r; and Sidi Maula, who possessed the power of
transmuting metals into gold. Lastly comes Sh&acirc;h Daula, whose
shrine is at Gujar&acirc;t in the Panj&acirc;b. His priest is able to
confer offspring on childless people on condition that they dedicate
the first child to the saint, and this child is then born with the head
of a rat. Some wretched imbeciles with rat-like features are found at
his tomb.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4141src" href="#xd21e4141" name=

<p>These wonder-working shrines belong to Hindu as well as
Musalm&acirc;n saints. In the Etah District is the tomb of Kaly&acirc;n
Bh&acirc;rati, a Hindu ascetic. He was buried alive at his own request
about four hundred years ago. Before his death he announced that
exactly six months after he was dead the arch of his tomb would crack,
and so it happened. Now a mound of earth in the centre is supposed to
mark the head of the saint. The virtue of his shrine is such that if
any one take a false oath within its precincts he will die at once. The
tomb is hence largely used for the settlement of disputes, and many a
wearied district officer longs that there were more such places
throughout the land.</p>

notorious cures, which have been performed by the intervention of the

noted for its power in cases of snake-bite and scrofula. A large

a wealthy tailor, who was cured of sore disease of the loins.<a class=

disease, &ldquo;Begone, you rascal!&rdquo; and the child is cured. At
the tomb of P&icirc;r Jah&acirc;niy&acirc;n in the Muzaffargarh
District, people suffering from leprosy and boils get the incumbent to
prepare baths of heated sand, in which the diseased part, or the whole
body is placed. The efficacy of the remedy is ascribed to the

Hughli, sacred to Mah&acirc;deva, of Vaidyan&acirc;tha in the
Sant&acirc;l Parganas, and Gondalp&acirc;ra in Hughli, famous in cases
of hydrophobia. &ldquo;The device followed at the last place is for the
bitten person, after fasting, to defray the expense of a special
service, and to receive a piece of broad cloth impregnated with the
snuff of a lamp-wick, and secreted in the heart of a plantain. As long
as this charm is preserved and the patient abstains from eating of this
variety of plantain, the effects of the bite are warded off. Another
plan is for the patient to take a secret medicine, probably
cantharides, pounded with twenty-one pepper-corns, before the
twenty-first day. This causes the patient to throw off some mucus,
known as &lsquo;the dog&rsquo;s whelp,&rsquo; and this leads to
cure.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4167src" href="#xd21e4167"

<h3 class="main">Wonder-working Tombs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are other tombs which present special
peculiarities. Thus, not long since crowds of people assembled at
Khetwadi, in Bombay, to see a shrine erected by some sweepers to
Z&acirc;hir P&icirc;r, which at intervals seemed to oscillate from its
foundations. At Anjar in Sindh are the tombs of a noted outlaw named
Jaisar P&icirc;r and his wife Tur&icirc; Khatr&acirc;n&icirc;, who were
originally buried apart, but their tombs are gradually approaching, and
it is believed that at their meeting <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>the world will be
destroyed. So there is a wall at Gurd&acirc;spur which a Faq&icirc;r
saw being built, and asked the master-mason if he considered it to be
firm. The mason said that he believed it to be substantial, whereupon
the holy man touched it and made it shake, and it has gone on shaking
ever since. At Faiz&acirc;b&acirc;d is the tomb of a saint, and some
time ago the metal top of one of the pinnacles took to shaking, and the
weaver population were so impressed that they levied a tax on the
community for its repair. At Jhanjh&acirc;na is the tomb of Sayyid
Mahm&ucirc;d, who was buried next to one of his disciples. But the
latter is too modest to place himself on an equality with his master,
so his tomb, however much it is repaired, always sinks to a lower level
than that of his preceptor. At B&acirc;rabanki is the tomb of the saint
Shaikh Ahmad Abdul-haq, who thought he could acquire some useful
information by keeping company with the dead. So he got himself buried
alive, and after six months his grave opened of its own accord and he
was taken out half dead.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Nine-yard Tombs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is another class of tombs which are known as the
Naugaza or Naugaja, that is to say tombs nine yards long. In these rest
the giants of the older world. There is one of these tombs at
N&acirc;gaur in R&acirc;jput&acirc;na, and several others have been
discovered in the course of the Arch&aelig;ological Survey.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4203src" href="#xd21e4203" name=
"xd21e4203src">90</a> Five of them at Vijhi measure respectively 29,
31, 30 and 38 feet. Mr. W. Simpson calls these tombs Buddhistic, but
this is very doubtful.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4206src" href=
"#xd21e4206" name="xd21e4206src">91</a> The belief largely prevails
among Muhammadans that there were giants in the early times. Adam
himself is said to have been sixty yards in height, and there was a
monster called &rsquo;Uj in the days of Adam, and the flood of Noah
reached only to his waist. There is a tomb of Noah at
Faiz&acirc;b&acirc;d which is said to have been built by Alexander the
Great, and not far off are those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224"
href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>of Seth and Job. The latter,
curiously enough, are gradually growing in size. They are now 17 and 12
feet long respectively, but when Abul Fazl wrote they were only
10&ndash;1/2 and 9 feet long.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4211src" href=

<h3 class="main">Shrines with Images or Relics.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The reputation, again, of many shrines rests on the
assumed discovery, generally by means of a dream, that an ancient image
or the bones of a martyr were buried on the spot, and in their honour a
shrine was established. Thus, the great temple at Bandakpur in the
Damoh District owes its origin to the fact that a Pandit in 1781 A.D.
dreamed a dream, that in a certain spot lay buried in the earth an
image of Jag&icirc;swar Mah&acirc;deva, and that if he built a suitable
temple over the place indicated, the image would make its appearance.
On the strength of this dream the Pandit built a temple, and it is
asserted that in due course of time the image developed itself without
the aid of man.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4219src" href="#xd21e4219"
name="xd21e4219src">93</a> So, the Bhairava temple on the Lang&ucirc;r
peak owes its establishment to a cowherd having found on the spot a
yellow-coloured stick, which on his attempting to cut it with an axe,
poured out drops of blood. Frightened at the sight, the cowherd fled,
only to be visited at night by the god in his terrible form, who
commanded him to set up his shrine here. A similar legend is attached
to the N&acirc;r&acirc;yana image in Nep&acirc;l.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4222src" href="#xd21e4222" name="xd21e4222src">94</a> The
celebrated shrine of Hanum&acirc;n at Beguthiya was discovered by a
wandering ascetic,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4225src" href=
"#xd21e4225" name="xd21e4225src">95</a> and a G&ucirc;jar cowboy is
said not very long ago to have found in one of the Sah&acirc;ranpur
jungles the image of the goddess S&acirc;kambar&icirc; Dev&icirc;,
which now attracts large numbers of worshippers. The
Mah&acirc;r&acirc;ja of Balr&acirc;mpur some time ago noticed a rude
shrine of Bijleswar&icirc; Dev&icirc;, the goddess of lightning, and
remarked that he would build a handsome temple in honour of her, were
it not for the sacred banyan tree which shaded it and prevented
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>the erection of the spire to the proper height.
That very night the tree was uprooted by a hurricane, and a handsome
temple was erected, this manifestation of her power having made the
goddess more popular than ever.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4230src"
href="#xd21e4230" name="xd21e4230src">96</a></p>
<p>Mistakes are, however, sometimes made. This was the case some time
ago at Ajudhya, where certain images were discovered and worshipped,
until a learned Pandit ascertained that they were actually the deities
of the aboriginal Bhars, who used to sacrifice Br&acirc;hmans to them.
They were really Jaina images, but it is needless to say that their
worship was immediately abandoned.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4235src"
href="#xd21e4235" name="xd21e4235src">97</a></p>
<p>As is only natural, shrines which have been discovered in this way
at the outset rest under a certain degree of suspicion, and have to
make their reputation by works of healing and similar miracles. If they
fail to do so they sink into disrepute. Such was the case with a very
promising shrine, supposed to be that of the saint Ashraf &rsquo;Ali,
whose bones were found accidentally not long ago at Ahraura in the
Mirzapur District. It enjoyed considerable reputation for a time, but
failing to maintain its character, was finally discredited and
abandoned.</p>
<p>Continuous respect is naturally accorded to ancient saints and local
godlings, who have long since established their claim to recognition by
a series of exhibitions of their thaumaturgic virtues. But the
competition is so keen and the pecuniary value of a successful
institution of this kind so considerable, that the claims of any
interloper must be well tested and approved before it establishes its
position and succeeds in attracting pilgrims.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Curing of Barrenness.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Barrenness is in popular belief mainly due to the
agency of evil spirits. Sterile women were in Rome beaten with rods by
the naked youths who ran through the city at the Lupercalia. The
barren, as Shakespeare says, &ldquo;Touched by this holy chase, shake
off their sterile curse.&rdquo; In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226"
href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>Bombay it is believed that
the cause of not getting children is that the man or his wife must have
killed a serpent in their former birth, whose spirit haunts them and
makes the woman barren. To get rid of the spirit which causes
sterility, the serpent&rsquo;s image is burnt and its funeral rites are
performed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4249src" href="#xd21e4249" name=
"xd21e4249src">98</a> The desire for male offspring is so intense that
some of these shrines do a thriving trade in providing nostrums for
this purpose.</p>
<p>One extraordinary method of procuring children, which long troubled
our magistrates in Upper India, was for the would-be mother to burn
down the hut of some neighbour. The Panj&acirc;bi woman, who under the
reign of British law is prevented from burning the house of her
neighbour, now takes a little grass from seven thatches and burns
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4254src" href="#xd21e4254" name=
"xd21e4254src">99</a></p>
<p>In another form of the charm the Kh&acirc;ndh priest takes the woman
to the confluence of two streams, sprinkles water over her to purify
her from the dangerous influence of the spirit and makes an offering to
the god of births.</p>
<p>Some special influence has been in many lands considered to attach
to a person who has been publicly executed, and to the appliances used
by the hangman.</p>
<p>Recently at an execution in Bombay, the hangman was observed to
carefully secure the rope, and particularly that part of it which had
encircled the neck of the culprit. He stated that he could sell every
quarter inch of it, as it averted evil spirits and ghosts, and even
prevented death from hanging. This idea accounts for the respect paid
throughout Europe to the mandrake, which is supposed to be generated
from the droppings of the brain of a thief on the gallows. In Cornwall
a wen or strumous swelling can be cured by touching it with the hand of
a man who has been publicly hanged.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4263src"
href="#xd21e4263" name="xd21e4263src">100</a> According to the same
principle, barren women in India bathe underneath a person who has been
hanged, and women of the middle classes try to obtain a piece of the
wood of the gallows for the same object. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another practice depends upon the principle that creeping under a
bent tree or through a perforated stone expels the demon. Other
instances of this will be given in another place. Hence in
Gujar&acirc;t, when an ascetic of the D&ucirc;ndiya sect dies, women
who seek the blessing of a son try to secure it by creeping under the
litter on which his corpse is removed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4269src" href="#xd21e4269" name="xd21e4269src">101</a></p>
<p>A rite carried out with the same object rests on a sort of symbolic
magic indicating fertility. Along the roads may often be seen trees
almost destroyed by a noxious creeper known as the Ak&acirc;sh Bel.
Women in hope of offspring often transplant this from one tree to
another, and are thus a decided nuisance to a district officer with a
taste for arboriculture.</p>
<p>But the most approved plan is to visit a shrine with a reputation
for healing this class of malady. There the patient is given a
cocoanut, which is a magic substance, a fruit, or even a barley-corn
from the holy of holies. Mr. Hartland has recently made an elaborate
study of this subject, and he points out the principle on which the
eating of such substances produced the desired effect. &ldquo;Whether
from an analogy between the normal act of impregnation and that of
eating and drinking, or because savages had learnt that at least one
mode of operating effectively on the organism, for purposes alike of
injury and healing, was by drugs taken through the mouth, this was the
favourite method of supernatural impregnation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again&mdash;&ldquo;Flowers, fruit and other vegetables, eggs,
fishes, spiders, worms, and even stones, are all capable of becoming
human beings. They only await absorption in the shape of food, or in
some other appropriate manner, into the body of a woman, to enable the
metamorphosis to be accomplished.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4278src" href="#xd21e4278" name="xd21e4278src">102</a></p>
<p>The same idea constantly occurs in Indian folk-lore. The barren
queen is given the juice of a pomegranate by a Faq&icirc;r, or the king
plucks one of the seven mangoes which grow on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>a
special tree, or a beggar gives the princess the drug which causes her
to give birth to twins.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4285src" href=
"#xd21e4285" name="xd21e4285src">103</a> Even in the
R&acirc;m&acirc;yana we read that R&acirc;ja Dasaratha divides the
oblation among his wives and they conceive. Even nowadays in Florence,
if a woman wishes to be with child, she goes to a priest and gets from
him an enchanted apple, with which she repairs to Saint Anna, who was
the Lucina of Roman times, and repeats a prayer or a spell.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4288src" href="#xd21e4288" name=
"xd21e4288src">104</a></p>
<p>Some holy men, it must be admitted, do not escape the tongue of
slander for their doings in this department of their business.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Harmless Saints and Godlings.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most of these saints and godlings whom we have been
considering, are comparatively harmless, and even benevolent. Such is
nearly always the case with the ghosts of the European dead, who are
constantly deified. Perhaps because the S&acirc;hib is such a curiously
incomprehensible personage to the rustic, he is believed to retain his
powers in the other world. But it is a remarkable and unconscious
tribute to the foreign ruler that his ghost should be beneficent.</p>
<p>The gardener in charge of the station cemetery in Mirzapur some time
ago informed me that he constantly sees the ghosts of the ladies and
gentlemen buried there coming out for a walk in the hot summer nights,
and that they never harm him.</p>
<p>But with ordinary graves it is necessary to be cautious. As appears
in the cycle of tales which turn on the magic ointment which enables
the possessor to see the beings of the other world, spirits hate being
watched. The spirit, for instance, often announces its wishes. When the
Emperor Tughlaq began to build the tomb of the Saint Bah&acirc;wal Haq,
a voice was heard from below, saying, &ldquo;You are treading on my
body.&rdquo; Another site was chosen at a short <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>distance, and the voice said, &ldquo;You are
treading on my knees.&rdquo; He went a little further, and the voice
said, &ldquo;You are treading on my toes.&rdquo; So he had to go to the
other end of the fort, and as the voice was not heard there, the tomb
was built. If you visit an old tomb, it is well to clap your hands, as
the ghost sometimes revisits its resting-place, and if discovered in
<i>d&eacute;shabille</i>, is likely to resent the intrusion in a very
disagreeable manner. So it is very dangerous to pollute a tomb or
insult its occupant in any way, and instances have occurred of cases of
epilepsy and hysteria, which were attributed to the neglect of these
precautions.</p>
<p>Thus, there is nothing permanent, no established rule of faith in
the popular belief of the rustic. Discredited saints and shrines are
always passing into contempt and oblivion; new worthies are being
constantly canonized. The worst part of the matter is that there is no
official controller of the right to deification, no <span lang=
"la">Advocatus Diaboli</span> to dispute the claims of the candidate to
celestial honours. At the same time the system, though often
discredited by fraud, admirably illustrates the elastic character of
the popular creed. Hinduism would hardly be so congenial to the minds
of the masses, if some rigid supervising agency disputed the right of
any tribe to worship its hero, of any village to canonize its local
worthy. The steady popularity of the system, for the present at least,
shows that it satisfactorily provides for the religious wants of the
people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=

<p class="first">These deified ghosts and saints whom we have been
discussing, though occasionally touchy and sensitive to insult or

<p class="first">It is not difficult to understand why the spirits of
the dead should be regarded as hostile. A stranger is, in the belief of
all primitive people, synonymous with an enemy; and the spirit of the
departed having abandoned his own and joined some other and invisible
tribe, whose domains lie outside the world of sense, is sure to be
considered inimical to the survivors left on earth. As we have already
seen, even the usually kindly spirit of the departed household dead
requires propitiation and resents neglect; much more those of a
different tribe or family.</p>
<p>Again, those disembodied souls in particular whose departure from
the earth occurred under unexpected or specially tragical circumstances
are naturally considered to have been ejected against their will from
their tenement of clay, and as for many of them the proper funeral
rites have not been performed, they carry with them to the next world
an angry longing for revenge. As Brand, writing of British <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>ghosts, says, &ldquo;The ghosts of murdered
persons, whose bodies have been secretly buried, are restless until
their bones have been taken up and deposited in consecrated ground with
the due rites of Christian burial; this idea being the survival of the
old heathen superstition that Charon was not allowed to ferry over the
ghosts of the unburied, but that they wandered up and down the banks of
the river Styx for a period of a hundred years, at the expiration of
which they were admitted to a passage.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>This conception of the state of the soul after death may be

<h3 class="main">Savage Theory of Dreams.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many savages believe that the evidence of dreams is
sufficient to prove that the soul moves about during sleep, and that
the dream is the record of its experiences in hunting, dancing,
visiting friends, and so on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Separable Soul.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hence arises the possibility that in the temporary
absence of a man&rsquo;s soul his body may be occupied by some other
person&rsquo;s spirit, or even by a malignant ghost or demon. In the
Panchatantra there is a story of a king who lost his own soul, but
afterwards recovered it. A Panj&acirc;b tale tells how a Hindu was once
asleep and his soul went on its travels as usual. During its wanderings
it felt thirsty and went into a pitcher of water to drink. While it was
in the pitcher some one shut the lid, and it was imprisoned. His
friends took the corpse to the cremation ground, but some one happened
fortunately to open the pitcher just in time, and the spirit flew into
its own body, which awoke on the bier.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4370src" href="#xd21e4370" name="xd21e4370src">2</a> In the same
way, according to Apollonius, the soul of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>Hermotimos of
Klazomenoe left his body frequently, resided in different places,
uttered all sorts of predictions, and used to come back to his body,
which remained in his house. At last some spiteful persons burnt his
body in the absence of his soul. In another tale of Somadeva the soul
of Chandraprabha abandons his own body and enters that of a hero under
the influence of M&acirc;y&acirc; or delusion.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4375src" href="#xd21e4375" name="xd21e4375src">3</a></p>
<p>On this principle Hindus are very cautious about awaking a sleeping
friend, lest his soul may happen to be absent at the time, and in
Bombay it is considered most reprehensible to play jokes on a sleeping
person, such as painting the face in fantastic colours, or giving
moustaches to a sleeping woman. The absent soul may not be able to find
its own body, the appearance of which has been thus changed, and may
depart altogether, leaving the body a corpse.</p>
<p>It is a common incident of the folk-tales that the soul departs in a
dream and falls in love with a girl. We have it in the common tale of
the Rival Queens, where the king sees in a dream the most lovely woman
in the world, and imposes on his courtiers the task of finding her. The
same idea is found more or less in Somadeva, and constantly recurs in
European folk-lore.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4382src" href=
"#xd21e4382" name="xd21e4382src">4</a> In the same way we have the
well-known tale of the instantaneous lapse of time in dreams, as that
of the king who plunges his head into water, goes through wondrous
adventures, and when he takes his head out of the vessel, finds himself
surrounded by his courtiers as before.</p>
<p>The rustic Hindu firmly believes that in the absence of a
man&rsquo;s proper soul in a dream his body is occupied by some strange
and consequently malignant ghost. Hence come the nightmare and evil
dreams. Thus the Korwas of Mirzapur believe that a Bh&ucirc;tin or
dangerous female ghost named Reiy&acirc; besets them at night under the
orders of some witch, and attacks people&rsquo;s joints with the
rheumatism. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>The Majhw&acirc;rs believe that the
R&acirc;kshasa attacks them in dreams. He comes in the shape of an old
man with enormous teeth, brown of colour, with black, entangled hair,
and sometimes swallows his victims. It is fear of him that brings the
fever, and he can be exorcised only by the Baiga with an offering of
rice and pulse. The D&acirc;no also comes in dreams, squeezes a
man&rsquo;s throat, and stops his breath. The Bhuiy&acirc;rs have
adopted from the Hindu mythology Jam or Yama as one of their dream
ghosts. He sits on his victim&rsquo;s breast in sleep, and it is
impossible to shake him off or make an alarm. Sometimes these night
ghosts come as tigers, wolves, or bears, and hunt a man down in his
sleep.</p>
<p>On the same principle the shadow of a man is believed to be part of
a man&rsquo;s soul, and may be separated from him, injured or wounded
by an enemy. Hence it is considered dangerous to tread on the shadow of
a man in the sunshine. Buddha is said to have left his shadow in the
cave at Pabhosa, where he killed the N&acirc;ga.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4397src" href="#xd21e4397" name="xd21e4397src">5</a></p>
<p>The same is the case with looking into other people&rsquo;s mirrors,
because you may chance leave behind your reflection, which is part of
your soul. As we have seen, this is the basis of much of the theory of
water spirits, which lurk in water holes and seize the reflection of
anyone who looks into them. The Sunni Muhammadans in Bombay cover up
all the looking-glasses in a house when a person is sick, as the soul,
which is just then on the prowl, may be absorbed, and leave its owner a
corpse.</p>
<p>Lastly, the same theory accounts for the disinclination which
rustics have to being painted or photographed. Some of the soul goes
out in the image and does not return. There is a rest-house on the
Asthbhuja Hill at Mirzapur which was many years ago presented to the
Europeans of the station by a wealthy banker. He was overpersuaded to
allow his picture to be painted, and fell into a lingering consumption,
of which he soon after died. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Bh&ucirc;t.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The general term for these spirits is Bh&ucirc;t, in
Sanskrit Bh&ucirc;ta, which means &ldquo;formed&rdquo; or
&ldquo;created.&rdquo; In the earlier Hindu writings the word is
applied to the powers of Nature, and even to deities. Siva himself is
called Bh&ucirc;t&icirc;svara, or &ldquo;Lord of spirits,&rdquo; and,
under the name of Bh&ucirc;t&icirc;svara Mah&acirc;deva, has a shrine
at Mathura. But as the Greek D&aelig;mon acquired a less respectable
meaning in the later ages of the history of the nation, so Bh&ucirc;t
has now come to imply a malignant evil spirit.</p>
<p>But Bh&ucirc;t is a general term which includes many grades of evil
spirits which it is necessary to distinguish. We shall first, however,
deal with certain characters common to Bh&ucirc;ts in general.</p>
<p>The proper Bh&ucirc;t is the spirit emanating from a man who has
died a violent death, either by accident, suicide, or capital
punishment. Such a soul reaches an additional grade of malignancy if he
has been denied proper funeral ceremonies after death. This is one of
his special wants which deprive the spirit of his longed-for rest.
Thus, we read in Childe Harold, &ldquo;Unsepulchred they roamed and
shrieked, each wandering ghost.&rdquo; The shade of Patroclus appeared
to Achilles in his sleep and demanded the performance of his funeral,
and the younger Pliny tells of a haunted house in Athens, in which a
ghost played all kinds of pranks owing to his funeral rites having been
neglected. This idea is at the base of the Hindu funeral ceremonies,
and of the periodical Sr&acirc;ddha. Hence arose the conception of the
Gay&acirc;l, or sonless ghost. He is the spirit of a man who has died
without any issue competent to perform the customary rites; hence he is
spiteful, and he is especially obnoxious to the lives of the young sons
of other people. Accordingly in every Panj&acirc;b village will be seen
small platforms, with rows of little hemispherical depressions into
which milk and Ganges water are poured, and by which lamps are lit and
Br&acirc;hmans fed to conciliate the Gay&acirc;l; &ldquo;while the
careful mother will always dedicate a rupee to him, and hang it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>round her child&rsquo;s neck till he grows
up.&rdquo; Mr. Ibbetson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4417src" href=
"#xd21e4417" name="xd21e4417src">6</a> suggests that this may have been
the origin of the mysterious so-called &ldquo;cup-marks,&rdquo;
described by Mr. Rivett-Carnac. But this is far from certain; they may
equally well have been used for sacrifices to Mother Earth, or in any
other primeval form of worship.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Shrines to Persons Accidentally Killed.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many of these shrines to persons who have died by an
untimely death are known by special names, which indicate the character
of the accident. We shall meet again with the Baghaut, or shrine, to a
man killed by a tiger. We have also Bijaliya B&icirc;r, the man who was
killed by lightning, T&acirc;r B&icirc;r, a man who fell from a
T&acirc;r or toddy tree, and N&acirc;giya B&icirc;r, a person killed by
a snake. General Cunningham mentions shrines of this kind; one to an
elephant driver who was killed by a fall from a tree, another to a
Br&acirc;hman who was killed by a cow, a third to a Kashm&icirc;ri lady
who had only one leg and died in her flight from Delhi to Oudh of
exhaustion on the journey.</p>
<p>Bh&ucirc;ts are most to be feared by women and children, and by
people at any serious crisis of their lives, such as marriage or
child-birth. They also attack people after eating sweets, &ldquo;so
that if you treat a school to sweetmeats, the sweetmeat seller will
also bring salt, of which he will give a pinch to each boy to take the
sweet taste out of his mouth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Second Marriage and Bh&ucirc;ts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Women who have married a second time are specially
liable to the envious attacks of the first husband. If in Bombay
&ldquo;a Mah&acirc;deo Koli widow bride or her husband sicken, it is
considered the work of the former husband. Among the Somavansi
Kshatriyas, there is a strong belief <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>that when a woman
marries another husband, her first husband becomes a ghost and troubles
her. This fear is so strongly rooted in their minds, that whenever a
woman of this caste sickens, she attributes her sickness to the ghost
of her former husband, and consults an exorcist as to how she can get
rid of him. The exorcist gives her some charmed rice, flowers, and
basil leaves, and tells her to enclose them in a small copper box and
wear it round her neck. Sometimes the exorcist gives her a charmed
cocoanut, which he tells her to worship daily, and in some cases he
advises the woman to make a copper or silver image of the dead and
worship it every day.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4443src" href=
"#xd21e4443" name="xd21e4443src">9</a></p>
<p>So in Northern India, people who marry again after the death of the
first wife wear what is known as the Saukan Maura, or second
wife&rsquo;s crown. This is a little silver amulet, generally with an
image of Dev&icirc; engraved on it. This is hung round the
husband&rsquo;s neck, and all presents made to the second wife are
first dedicated to it. The idea is that the new wife recognizes the
superiority of her predecessor, and thus appeases her malignity. The
illness or death of the second wife or of her husband soon after
marriage is attributed to the jealousy of the ghost of the first wife,
which has not been suitably propitiated.</p>
<p>In the Panj&acirc;b, on the same principle, if a man has lost two or
three wives in succession, he gets a woman to catch a bird and adopt it
as her daughter. He then pays the dower, marries his bird bride, and
immediately divorces her. By this means the malignant influence is
diverted to the bird, and the real wife is safe.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4450src" href="#xd21e4450" name="xd21e4450src">10</a> We shall

purpose may have been for which it has been used. On the other hand,
they are very fond of milk, and no Panj&acirc;bi woman likes her child
to leave the house after drinking fresh milk. If she cannot prevent it
from going, she puts some salt or ashes into its mouth to scare the
Bh&ucirc;t.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4460src" href="#xd21e4460" name=

<h3 class="main">Posture of Bh&ucirc;ts.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bh&ucirc;ts can never sit on the ground, apparently,
because, as has been shown already, the earth, personified as a
goddess, scares away all evil influence. Hence, near the low-caste
shrines a couple of pegs or bricks are set up for the Bh&ucirc;t to
rest on, or a bamboo is hung over it, on which the Bh&ucirc;t perches
when he visits the place.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4469src" href=
"#xd21e4469" name="xd21e4469src">12</a> On the same principle the
Or&acirc;ons hang up the cinerary urn containing the bones of a dead
man on a post in front of the house,<a class="noteref" id=

person who is going on a pilgrimage, or conveying the bones of a
relative to the Ganges, sleeps on the ground; but the bones must not
rest on the ground; they are hung on the branch of a tree, so that
their late owner may revisit them if so disposed. Near shrines where
Bh&ucirc;ts are always about on the chance of appropriating the
offerings, it is expedient to sleep on the ground. So the bride and
bridegroom rest, and the dying man is laid at the moment of
dissolution.</p>

<h3 class="main">Tests of Bh&ucirc;ts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are at least three infallible tests by which you
may recognize a Bh&ucirc;t. In the first place he casts no shadow. In
the third Canto of the Purgatorio, Dante is much distressed because
Virgil, being a disembodied spirit, casts no shadow. In the second
place a Bh&ucirc;t can stand almost anything in his neighbourhood but
the scent of burning turmeric, which, as we shall see, is a well-known
demon-scarer. Thirdly, a genuine Bh&ucirc;t always speaks with a nasal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>twang, and it is possibly for this last reason
that the term for the gibberish in the medi&aelig;val plays and for
modern English is Pis&acirc;cha Bh&acirc;sha, or the language of
goblins.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4482src" href="#xd21e4482" name=
"xd21e4482src">14</a> Some of them have throats as narrow as a needle,
but they can drink gallons of water at a time. Some, like the Churel,
whom we shall meet later on, have their feet turned backwards. Some,
like Br&acirc;hman ghosts, are wheat-coloured or white; others, like
the K&acirc;fari, the ghost of a murdered negro, are black, and
particularly dreaded. A famous ghost of this class haunts a lane in
Calcutta, which takes its name from him.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Spirit Entries: The Head.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Spirits enter and leave the body in various ways. They
often use the head in this way, and in particular the tenth aperture of
the body, one of the skull sutures, known as Brahma-randhra. This is
the reason why the skull is broken at cremation to open the
&ldquo;crevice of Brahma,&rdquo; as this orifice is called.</p>
<p>In the case of one of the ascetic orders, who are buried and not
cremated, a blow is given on the head with a cocoanut or a conch shell.
Thus, when the chief teacher of the Br&acirc;hmans in Bombay dies, his
successor breaks a cocoanut on his skull and makes an opening, in which
the sacred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>S&acirc;lagr&acirc;ma stone is laid.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4501src" href="#xd21e4501" name=
"xd21e4501src">15</a> This rite of skull-breaking, which is done by the
next relation, is a recognized part of the Hindu cremation rite, and is
known as Kap&acirc;lakriya.</p>
<p>The same theory that the head is an entry for spirits accounts for
numerous strange practices. Thus, when in Kumaun a man is bitten by a
snake they pull three hairs from his scalp-lock and strike him three
times on the top of the head with the first joint of the middle finger,
a kind of blow which in ordinary cases is regarded with the utmost
terror. So when a person has fever, they take a bone and fill it with
grain, and, making the patient stand in the sun, dig a hole where the
shadow of his head falls, and there bury the bone, saying,
&ldquo;Fever! Begone with the bone!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4506src" href="#xd21e4506" name="xd21e4506src">16</a> At a Gond
wedding, the old man who officiates knocks the heads of the bride and
bridegroom together to scare the evil spirits,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4509src" href="#xd21e4509" name="xd21e4509src">17</a> and at a
Hindu marriage in Northern India the mother of the youth, as he leaves
to fetch his bride, and as he returns with her, waves lamps, a brass
tray, grain, and a rice pounder, to drive off the Bh&ucirc;ts
fluttering round his head. It is on the same principle that the
bridegroom wears a marriage crown, and this also accounts for many of
the customs of blessing by the laying on of hands and anointing which
prevail all over the world. In the same way the hair has always been
regarded as a spirit entry. Magistrates in Northern India are often
troubled by people who announce their intention of &ldquo;letting their
hair grow&rdquo; at some one whom they desire to injure. This, if one
can judge by the manifest terror exhibited by the person against whom
this rite is directed, must be a very stringent form of coercion. For
the same reason ascetics wear the hair loose and keep it uncut, as
Sampson did, and the same idea probably accounts for the rites of
ceremonial shaving of youths, and of the mourners after death.

<h3 class="main">Sneezing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So, sneezing is due to demoniacal influence, but
opinions differ as to whether it is caused by a Bh&ucirc;t entering or
leaving the nose. The latter view is generally taken by
Musalm&acirc;ns, because it is one of the traditions of the Prophet
that the nose should be washed out with water, as the devil resides in
it during the night. The sneezing superstition in India is at least as
old as the Buddhist J&acirc;takas, where we have a remarkable tale
about it, which describes how the future Buddha and his father Gagga
went to pass the night in a place haunted by a Yakkha, or Yaksha, and
were very near being devoured by him because they did not say the spell
&ldquo;Live!&rdquo; when they sneezed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4532src" href="#xd21e4532" name="xd21e4532src">19</a></p>
<p>So, in Somadeva&rsquo;s tale of Sulochana and Sushena, the spirit of
the air says, &ldquo;When he enters into his private apartments, he
shall sneeze a hundred times; and if some one there does not say to him
a hundred times, &lsquo;God bless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241"
href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>you,&rsquo; he shall fall
into the grasp of death.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4541src"
href="#xd21e4541" name="xd21e4541src">20</a> It is needless to say that
the same belief prevails in Europe. As Dr. Tylor says, &ldquo;Even the
Emperor Tiberius, that saddest of men, exacted this observance.&rdquo;
According to the Muhammadan rule, if a person sneezes and then says
immediately afterwards, <i>Al-hamdu li&rsquo;llah</i>, &ldquo;God be
praised,&rdquo; it is incumbent upon at least one of the party to
reply, <i>Yarhamu-ka &rsquo;llah</i>, just as among the Jews the
sneezing formula was <i>Tobkin Khayim</i>, &ldquo;Good life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the whole, sneezing is considered auspicious, because it implies
the expulsion of a Bh&ucirc;t. As a general rule, if a person sneezes
when another is beginning some work, the latter stops for a while, and
then begins afresh; if there be two sneezes in succession, there is no
necessity for interruption. If a man sneezes behind the back of
another, the back of the latter is slightly pinched. In Bombay, if a
man <span class="corr" id="xd21e4555" title=
"Source: sneeze">sneezes</span> during a meal, one of the party calls
on him to name his birthplace.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4558src"
href="#xd21e4558" name="xd21e4558src">21</a> The threshold in the
folk-lore of all nations is regarded as a sacred place. It is here,
according to the Scotch and Irish belief, that the house fairies
reside. Sitting on the threshold is believed by Indian matrons likely
to produce boils in children in that part of the body which touches it,
and it is thought most unlucky to sneeze on the threshold. On the
whole, one sneeze is ominous, while after two work may be commenced

<p class="first">The hands and feet are also means by which Bh&ucirc;ts
enter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=

and meals; the hand-clapping which accompanies so many religious and
mystical rites; the passing of the hand over the head; the laying of
the hands on the eyes to restore sight, of which we have many examples
in the Indian folk-tales; the hand-pledging at marriages; the drinking
of the Charan-amrita, or water, in which the feet of a holy man have
been washed; the ceremonial washing of the feet of the bridegroom at a
wedding by the father of the bride. The stock case of the danger of the
not washing the feet at night is that of Adil&icirc;, whose impurity
allowed Indra to form the Maruts out of her embryo. A man with flat
feet is considered most <span class="corr" id="xd21e4571" title=

meet a flat-soled man on Monday you are advised to go home, eat and
drink, or evil will befall you.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4574src"
href="#xd21e4574" name="xd21e4574src">23</a> The chief basis of
feet-washing is the idea that a person coming from abroad and not
immediately carrying out the required ablution runs the risk of
bringing some foreign, and presumably dangerous, spirit with him.</p>

communicate direct with the brain, and are kept by the rustic carefully

ear-piercing, which is in Northern India about the only survival of the
world-wide rite of mutilation when males attain puberty, and of wearing
ear-rings and similar ornaments, which is habitual with all classes of
Hindus, and specialized among the Kanphata Jogis, who take their name

<h3 class="main">Varieties of Bh&ucirc;ts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Bengal the ordinary Bh&ucirc;t is a member of the
Kshatriya, Vaisya, or S&ucirc;dra class. The Br&acirc;hman Bh&ucirc;t,
or Brahmadaitya, is quite another variety. The ordinary Bh&ucirc;ts are
as tall as palmyra trees, generally thin and very black. They
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>usually live on trees, except those which the
Brahmadaitya frequent. At night, and especially at the hour of
midnight, they wander about the fields frightening travellers. They
prefer dirty places to those which are clean; so when a person goes to
worship a Bh&ucirc;t, he does so in some dirty, retired place, and
gives him only half-cooked food, so that he may not have time to gobble
it up, and perchance rend his worshipper. They are never seen in the
temples of the gods, though they often, as we have seen, lurk about in
the vicinity in the hope of getting some of the offerings if the priest
be not on the alert and scare them with his bell or shell-trumpet. They
are always stark naked, and are fond of women, whom they sometimes
abduct. They eat rice, and all sorts of human food, but their favourite
diet is fish. Hence no Beng&acirc;li, except for a considerable bribe,
will talk about fish at night. Here they agree with the fairies of
Manxland. Professor Rhys<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4589src" href=
"#xd21e4589" name="xd21e4589src">24</a> <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e4592" title="Source: tell">tells</span> a story of a Manx
fisherman, who was taking a fresh fish home, and was pursued by a pack
of fairy dogs, so that it was only with great trouble he reached his
own door. He drove the dogs away with a stone, but he was shot by the
fairies, and had a narrow escape of his life. On the other hand, the
Small People in Cornwall hate the smell of fish as much as the savour
of salt or grease.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4595src" href=
"#xd21e4595" name="xd21e4595src">25</a> The best chance of escape from
these Bengal Bh&ucirc;ts is when they begin to quarrel among
themselves. A person beset by them should invoke the gods and
goddesses, especially K&acirc;l&icirc;, Durg&acirc;, and Siva, the last
of whom is, as already noted, the Lord of Bh&ucirc;ts.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4598src" href="#xd21e4598" name=
"xd21e4598src">26</a></p>
<p>Bh&ucirc;ts are of many varieties. Vet&acirc;la, or Bait&acirc;l,
their leader, is familiar to everyone in the tales of the Bait&acirc;l
Pach&icirc;si. He is not, as a rule, particularly offensive. More
usually he is a vagrant Bh&ucirc;t which enters the body of a man when
the real spirit is absent. But he often approximates to the Vampire as
we meet him in Western folk-lore. &ldquo;It is as a vitalized corpse
that the visitor from the other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244"
href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>world comes to trouble
mankind, often subject to human appetites, constantly endowed with more
than human strength and malignity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4605src" href="#xd21e4605" name="xd21e4605src">27</a> Thus in one
of Somadeva&rsquo;s stories the hero goes at night to a cemetery and
summons at the foot of a tree a Vet&acirc;la into the body of a man,
and after worshipping him, makes an oblation of human flesh to him. In
another there is a Vet&acirc;la with a body made up of the limbs of
many animals, who hurls the king to the earth, and when he sits on the
Vet&acirc;la&rsquo;s back the demon flies with him through the air like
a bird and flings him into the sea.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4608src"
href="#xd21e4608" name="xd21e4608src">28</a> The spirit entering the
body of the dead man forms the leading incident in the tale of
Fadlallah in the Arabian Nights, and there are many instances of it in
Indian folk-lore. This disposes of the assertion which has been
sometimes made that among races which bury their dead little is known
of regular corpse spectres, or that they are special to lands tenanted
or influenced by the Slavonians.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4611src"
href="#xd21e4611" name="xd21e4611src">29</a> Most usually the
Vet&acirc;la appears as the spirit of some living person dissatisfied
with his lodgings on earth, which leaves his own body and occupies a
corpse in preference. He, in company with the Vasus, Yakshas,
Bh&ucirc;tas, and Gandharvas, has passed into the degraded Tantrika
worship.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4614src" href="#xd21e4614" name=

<h3 class="main">The Pret.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Hindu notion of the state of the soul between
death and the performance of the prescribed funeral rites agrees
exactly with that of the older European races. They wandered about in a
state of unhappy restlessness, and were not suffered to mix with the
other dead. The term Pret or Preta, which simply means
&ldquo;deceased&rdquo; or &ldquo;departed,&rdquo; represents the soul
during this time. It wanders round its original home, and, like the
B&acirc;lakhilyas, who surround the chariot of the sun, is no larger
than a man&rsquo;s thumb. The stages of his progress, according to the
best authorities, are that up to the performance of the ten Pindas the
dead man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>remains a Preta, through the
N&acirc;r&acirc;yanabali rite he becomes a Pis&acirc;cha, and by the
Sapindikarana he reaches the dignity of the Pitri or sainted dead. The
term Preta is, however, sometimes applied to the spirit of a deformed
or crippled person, or one defective in some limb or organ, or of a
child who dies prematurely owing to the omission of the prescribed
ceremonies during the formation of the embryo. Here it may be noted
that there are indications in India of the belief which is common among
savages, that young children, apparently in consequence of their
incomplete protection from the birth impurity, are under a taboo. Thus
in India a child is regarded as a Bh&ucirc;t until the birth hair is
cut. Some of the jungle tribes believe that it is unnecessary to
protect a child from evil spirits until it begins to eat grain, because
up to that time it is nothing more than a Bh&ucirc;t itself. Under the
old ritual a child under two years of age was not burnt, but buried,
and no offering of water was made to it. We are familiar with the same
idea in England regarding unbaptized children, whose spirits are
supposed to be responsible for the noise of Gabriel&rsquo;s Hounds in
the sky, really caused by the bean geese in their southern flight.</p>
<p>The Pret is occasionally under provocation malignant, but as it
partakes to some degree of the functions of the benign ancestral
household spirit, it is not necessarily malicious or evil-disposed
towards living persons. The Pret is specially worshipped at Gaya on the
Hill, known as Pretsila, or &ldquo;the rock of the Pret,&rdquo; and a
special class of Br&acirc;hmans at Patna call themselves Pretiya,
because they worship the ghost of some hero or saint.<a class="noteref"

<h3 class="main">The Pis&acirc;cha.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next comes the Pis&acirc;cha, which, as we have seen,
is by one account only a stage in the progress of the soul to its final
rest. But more properly speaking it is an evil spirit produced by a
man&rsquo;s vices, the ghost of a liar, adulterer, or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>criminal of any kind, or of one who has died
insane. But his attributes and functions are not very clearly defined,
and he merges into the general class of Bh&ucirc;ts. In some cases he
seems to have the power to cure disease. Thus we read in Somadeva,
&ldquo;Rise up in the last watch of the night, and with dishevelled
hair, and naked, and without rinsing your mouth, take two handfuls of
rice as large as you can grasp with the two hands, and, uttering a form
of words, go to a place where four roads meet and there place the two
handfuls of rice, and return in silence without looking behind you. Do
so always until that Pis&acirc;cha appears and says, &lsquo;I will put
an end to your ailment.&rsquo; Then receive his aid gladly, and he will
remove your complaint.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4637src" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The R&acirc;kshasa.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The R&acirc;kshasa again, a word that means &ldquo;the
harmer&rdquo; or &ldquo;the destroyer,&rdquo; is of the ogre-vampire
type. He goes about at night, haunts cemeteries, disturbs sacrifices
and devout men, animates dead bodies, even devouring human beings, in
which capacity he is known as Kravy&acirc;da, or carnivorous, and is
generally hostile to the human race. He is emphatically a devourer of
human flesh, and eats carrion. He is often represented in the
folk-tales as having a pretty daughter, who protects the hero when he
ventures perchance into the abode of the monster. Her father comes in,
and with the cry of &ldquo;<i>Manush gandha</i>,&rdquo; which is
equivalent to the &ldquo;Fee! fo! fum! I smell the blood of an
Englishman!&rdquo; of the Western tale, searches about, but fails to
find him. When Hanum&acirc;n entered the city of Lanka in the form of a
cat, to reconnoitre, he saw that the R&acirc;kshasas who slept in the
house &ldquo;were of every shape and form. Some of them disgusted the
eye, while some were beautiful to look on. Some had long arms and
frightful shapes; some were very fat and some were very lean; some were
dwarf and some were prodigiously tall. Some had only one eye, and
others had only one ear. Some had monstrous bellies, hanging
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>breasts, long projecting teeth, and crooked
thighs; whilst others were exceedingly beautiful to behold and clothed
in great splendour. Some had the heads of serpents, some the heads of
asses, some of horses, and some of elephants.&rdquo; The leader of them
was R&acirc;vana, who is said to have been once a Br&acirc;hman and to
have been turned into a R&acirc;kshasa, &ldquo;with twenty arms,
copper-coloured eyes, and bright teeth like the young moon. His form
was as a thick cloud or as a mountain, or the god of death with open
mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&acirc;kshasa is the great <i>Deus ex machin&acirc;</i> of
folk-lore. He can change into almost any form he pleases, his breath is
a roaring wind; he can lengthen his arms to eighty miles; he can smell
out human beings like Giant Blunderbore. He can carry a man leagues
through the air; if his head be cut off, it grows again. He is the
Eastern type of the monster dragon which is subdued by St. George,
Siegmund, Siegfried, or Beowulf.</p>
<p>His spouse, the R&acirc;kshas&icirc;, is a creature of much the same
kind. In the folk-tales she often takes the form of the ogress queen
who marries the king and gets up at night and devours an elephant, or
two or three horses, or some sheep or a camel, and then puts the blood
and scraps of meat at the doors of her rivals, and gets them banished,
until the clever lad discovers her wiles and brings her to condign
punishment.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4657src" href="#xd21e4657" name=
"xd21e4657src">33</a> Often she besets a city and demands the daily
tribute of a human victim. The king takes the place of the victim, and
the R&acirc;kshas&icirc; is so affected by his generosity that she
abandons eating the flesh of men. In a case in the folk-tales a boy
becomes a R&acirc;kshasa by eating the brains of a corpse.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4660src" href="#xd21e4660" name=
"xd21e4660src">34</a> Like all other demons, R&acirc;kshasas are scared
by light, and one of the names of the lamp is R&acirc;kshogna, or
&ldquo;the destroyer of the R&acirc;kshasas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea of the R&acirc;kshasa comes from the earliest times. Some
have thought them to be types of the early Dr&acirc;vidian opponents of
the Hindus. Nirrit&icirc;, the female personification <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>of
death, is a R&acirc;kshasa deity in the Vedas, and Dr. Muir has traced
the various stages by which the R&acirc;kshasa was developed into a
godling.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4667src" href="#xd21e4667" name=
"xd21e4667src">35</a> Thus, in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, Jar&acirc;
is called a household goddess; the great King Jarasandha was born in
two halves, and Jar&acirc; united them; she is always represented as
seeking to requite by benefits the worship which is paid to her. Manu
prescribes a special oblation for &ldquo;the spirits which walk in
darkness.&rdquo; The blood in the sacrifice is, according to the old
ritual, offered to them, though even here we notice the transition from
animal to corn offerings.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4670src" href=
"#xd21e4670" name="xd21e4670src">36</a></p>
<p>Nowadays R&acirc;kshasas live in trees and cause vomiting and
indigestion to those who trespass on their domains at night. They
mislead night travellers like Will-o&rsquo;-the-Wisp, and they are
always greedy and in quest of food. So, if a man is eating by
lamp-light and the light goes out, he will cover the dish with his
hands, which are, as we have already seen, scarers of demons, to
preserve the food from the R&acirc;kshasa, and Bengal women go at night
with a lamp into every room to expel the evil spirits.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4675src" href="#xd21e4675" name=
"xd21e4675src">37</a></p>
<p>The R&acirc;kshasas are said to be always fighting with the gods and
their blood remains on many of these ghostly battlefields. In the Hills
this is believed to be the cause of the red ferruginous clay which is
occasionally observed, and the Loh&ucirc; or &ldquo;blood-red&rdquo;
river has a similar origin.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4680src" href=
"#xd21e4680" name="xd21e4680src">38</a> The same idea appears in the
folk-lore of Europe. In a Swabian legend the red colour of shoots of
rye when they first appear above the surface is attributed to Cain
having killed Abel in a rye-field, which thus became reddened with
innocent blood.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4683src" href="#xd21e4683"

<p>In folk-lore R&acirc;kshasas have kingdoms, and possess enormous
riches, which they bestow on those whom they favour, like
T&acirc;r&acirc; B&acirc;&icirc; in the story of Seventee
B&acirc;&icirc;. In this they resemble the Irish fairies, who hide away
much treasure in their palaces underneath the hills and in the lakes
and sea. &ldquo;All the treasure of wrecked ships is theirs; and all
the gold that men have hidden or buried in the earth when danger was on
them, and then died and left no sign to their descendants. And all the
gold of the mine and the jewels of the rocks belong to them, and in the
Sifra or fairy house the walls are silver and the pavement is gold, and
the banquet hall is lit by the diamonds that stud the
rocks.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4700src" href="#xd21e4700"
name="xd21e4700src">43</a></p>
<p>The finger nails of the R&acirc;kshasas, as those of Europeans in
popular belief, are a deadly poison, and the touch of them produces
insensibility, or even death. They often take the disguise of old women
and have very long hair, which is a potent charm. Their malignity is so
great that it would be difficult to avoid them, but fortunately, like
the Devil in the European tales, and evil spirits all the world over,
they are usually fools, and readily disclose the secrets of their
enchantment to the distressed heroine who is unlucky enough to fall
into their power, and the victim has generally only to address the
monster as &ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; to escape from his clutches.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4705src" href="#xd21e4705" name=

<p>They are, as has been said already, usually cannibals. One
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=

Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, who lived at Ekachakra and levied a daily toll
of food and human victims on the R&acirc;ja till he was torn to pieces
by Bh&icirc;ma. Bh&icirc;ma also contrived to kill another monster of
the same kind named Hidimba. In the great Panj&acirc;b legend of
Ras&acirc;lu, he conquers the seven R&acirc;kshasas, who used to eat a
human being every day, and there is a Nep&acirc;l story of the
R&acirc;kshasa Gurung M&acirc;pa, who used to eat corpses. He was
propitiated with a grant of land to live on and an annual offering of a
buffalo and some rice.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4715src" href=

many of the enormous fossil bones found in the Siw&acirc;lik Hills were

<h3 class="main">R&acirc;kshasas as Builders.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tales of Western lands abound with instances of
buildings, bridges, etc., constructed by the Devil. So the Indian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>R&acirc;kshasa is commonly regarded as an
architect. Thus, at R&acirc;mtek in the Central Provinces there is a
curious old temple built of hewn stones, well fitted together without
mortar. From its shape and structure it is probably of Jaina origin,
though local tradition connects it with the name of Hem&acirc;dpant,
the R&acirc;kshasa. He is an example of R&acirc;kshasas developed in
comparatively recent times from a historical personage. He was probably
the Minister of Mah&acirc;deva (1260&ndash;1271 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span>), the fourth of the Y&acirc;dava Kings of Deogiri.
According to the common story, he was a giant or a physician, who
brought the current Mar&acirc;thi character from Ceylon. The Dakkhin
swarms with ancient buildings attributed to him.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4744src" href="#xd21e4744" name="xd21e4744src">48</a></p>
<p>Such is also the case with another class of demons, the Asuras, a
word which means &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; or &ldquo;superhuman,&rdquo;
who were the rivals of the gods. In Mirzapur the ancient embankment at
the Karsota tank is considered to be their work. Once upon a time two
of these demons vowed that whoever first succeeded in building a fort
should be the conqueror, and that his defeated rival should lose his
life. So they set to work in the evening, one on the Bijaygarh Hill,
and the other on the opposite peak of Kundakot, about twelve miles
distant. The demon of Bijaygarh, having lost his tools in the dark,
struck a light to search for them. His adversary seeing the light, and
imagining that the sun was rising and his rival&rsquo;s work completed,
fled precipitously. The Bijaygarh fort was completed during the night
and stands to the present day, while on Kundakot you see only a few
enormous blocks of stone which was all the vanquished Asura had time to
collect. The tales of demons interfering with the construction of
buildings are common in European folk-lore.</p>
<p>Many other buildings are said to have been built in the same way.

was turned into a R&acirc;kshasa on account of his oppression of his
subjects, in which condition he resumed the evil work of his earthly
existence, &ldquo;devouring his subjects,&rdquo; until one of his
grandchildren offered himself as a victim to appease his hitherto
insatiable appetite. &ldquo;The language of innocent affection,&rdquo;

Br&acirc;hman ghost. These often develop into R&acirc;kshasas, and are

are haunted by the R&acirc;kshasa or ghost of the Br&acirc;hman Mansa
R&acirc;m, who, on account of the tyranny of the R&acirc;ja Tej Sinh,
committed suicide. He lives in a tree in a fort in the S&icirc;tapur

of the R&acirc;ja is undertaken until he has been duly
propitiated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4789src" href="#xd21e4789"

Br&acirc;hman named P&ucirc;ran Mall. The Br&acirc;hman asked the
R&acirc;ja to change the position of his sitting-room, as it was
inconvenient to the ladies of his family, and when the request was
refused, poisoned himself with a dose of opium. His body turned blue
like indigo, and he became a most malignant demon or B&icirc;r, known
as the Brahm R&acirc;kshasa, which caused the death of the R&acirc;ja
and his family, and forced his successors to remove to a distance from
their original family residence.</p>

classes of demons, known as Deo, D&acirc;no, or B&icirc;r. The Deo is a
survival of the Devas or &ldquo;shining ones&rdquo; of the old
mythology. It is another of the terms which have suffered grievous
degradation. It was originally applied to the thirty-three great
divinities, eleven of which inhabited each of the three worlds. Now the
term represents a vague class of the demon-ogre family. The Deo is a
cannibal, and were he not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href=

one of the Mirzapur villages is the shrine of Kharbar B&icirc;r, or
&ldquo;the noisy hero.&rdquo; No one can give any satisfactory account
of him, but it is quite certain that if he is not propitiated by the
Baiga, he brings disease on men and cattle. Gend&acirc; B&icirc;r, a
woman who was tired of life, and, instead of burning herself, threw
herself down from a tree, is worshipped at N&acirc;gpur.<a class=

districts of the North-West Provinces. He is said to have been a demon
who resided on the spot where the present fort of Jaunpur now stands.
He became such a pest to the country about, that the great R&acirc;ma
Chandra warred against him and overcame him. His head and limbs he
flung to the four corners of heaven, and his trunk in the form of a
shapeless mass of stone remains as a memorial and is worshipped. Some
allege that he was really some hero of the aboriginal Bhar race who
fell in battle with the Aryan. It is also alleged that when the British
engineers attempted to blow down the fort their mines failed to disturb
the shrine of Ker&acirc;r, whose importance has been much increased by

<p class="first">So with the Dait or Daitya, who is connected in
nothing but name with the demons of the olden world who warred with the
gods. In Mirzapur he lives in a tree; in front he looks like a man, but
seen from behind he is quite hollow, only a mere husk without a
backbone. In this he resembles the Ellekone of Denmark, who is
beautiful in front, but hollow in the back like a kneading
trough.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4831src" href="#xd21e4831" name=

off.</p>
<p>In Mirzapur he is sometimes known as Daitra B&icirc;r and is
associated with two others named Akata B&icirc;r and Latora B&icirc;r,

Col. Tod describes a place in the table-land of Central India known as
Daitya k&acirc; har or &ldquo;the demon&rsquo;s bone,&rdquo; on which
those who are in search of ease jump from above. Although most of the

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Headless Horseman.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the present time the most dreaded of these
creatures is, perhaps, the Headless Horseman, who is popularly known as
D&ucirc;nd, or &ldquo;truncated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He has many of his kindred in other lands. Sir Francis Drake used to
drive a hearse into Plymouth with headless horses and followed by
yelling hounds. Coluinn gun Cheann of the Highlands goes about a
headless trunk. A coach without horses used to career about the
neighbourhood of Listowel when any misfortune was about to take place.
A monster in one of the German tales carries about his head under his
arm.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4857src" href="#xd21e4857" name=
"xd21e4857src">65</a></p>
<p>By one account the D&ucirc;nd took his origin from the wars of the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata. However this may be, he appears periodically
in the form of a headless trunk seated on horseback, with his head tied
before him on the pommel of the saddle. He makes his rounds at night
and calls to the householder from outside; but woe to any one who
answers him, for this means death. The belief in these visionary death
summonses is very common. The Irish Banshee howls at night and
announces death. In Mirzapur, B&acirc;ghesar, or the tiger demon, lives
on the Churni Hill. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>sometimes comes down at night in
human form, and calls people by name at their doors. If any one answers
him he becomes sick. The Beng&acirc;li personifies Nisi or Night as the
Homeric Greeks did.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4864src" href=
"#xd21e4864" name="xd21e4864src">66</a> She often comes at midnight,
calls the house-master, who when he opens the door falls senseless and
follows her where she will. Sometimes she takes him into a tank and
drowns him, or leads him into a dense forest and drops him among thorns
or on the top of some high tree. In fact it is always very dangerous to
speak to these spirits or ghosts. Falstaff knew this well when he said,
&ldquo;They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The D&ucirc;nd makes occasional incursions throughout the country.
He was in the neighbourhood of Agra in 1882, and some twelve years
after appeared in Mirzapur. On both occasions the news of his arrival
caused considerable alarm. Every one shut up their houses at sunset,
and no one on any consideration would answer a call from outside after
nightfall. It was shrewdly suspected at the time that this rumour was
spread by some professional burglar who made a harvest while the scare
lasted.</p>
<p>Somewhat akin to the D&ucirc;nd is the spectral R&acirc;ja of
B&ucirc;ndi who occasionally appears in the neighbourhood of
Sah&acirc;ranpur. Some years ago a Br&acirc;hman astrologer heard some
one calling him from outside one night. When he answered the summons he
was told that the R&acirc;ja of B&ucirc;ndi wanted to have his
horoscope examined and was then encamped near the town. The Pandit
proceeded to the place with the guide and saw a splendid encampment,
and the R&acirc;ja in his royal robes sitting in a tent ornamented with
pearls. When he saw him the unfortunate astrologer knew that he was a
R&acirc;kshasa, and he was the more convinced of this when he examined
his horoscope and found that he was fated to live for ever. He told the
R&acirc;ja that his life would be long and prosperous, and after
receiving three gold coins as his fee went home more dead than alive.
Next morning he went <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258"
name="pb258">258</a>]</span>to the place, but could find no sign of the
camp, and when he looked in his box the coins were found to have
disappeared.</p>
<p>There are numerous other versions of the Headless Horseman story in
Northern India. In a fight at Kh&acirc;ndesh the G&acirc;oli prince
engaged in personal conflict with the saint Sayyid Saadat P&icirc;r,
and struck off his head. The headless body continued to fight, and the
Hindu army fled in panic. The trunk then snatched up the head and led
the victorious troops to a neighbouring hill, where the earth opened
and swallowed it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4875src" href="#xd21e4875"
name="xd21e4875src">67</a> So, in Oudh, Malik Ambar, the companion of
S&acirc;l&acirc;r Masaud, was, it is said, killed with his master at
Bahr&acirc;ich, but wandering back from Bijnor, a headless trunk on
horseback, he at length reached the place where his tomb now stands,
when the earth opened and received him and his horse.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4878src" href="#xd21e4878" name="xd21e4878src">68</a></p>
<p>The D&ucirc;nd is apparently a close relation of the
Skandhah&acirc;ta of Bengal, who goes about with his head cut off from
the shoulders. He dwells in low moist lands outside a village, in bogs
and fens, and goes about in the dark, rolling about on the ground, with
his long arms stretched out. Woe betide the belated peasant who falls
within his grasp.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4883src" href="#xd21e4883"

<p class="first">Closely connected with this are the numerous legends
of the Ghostly Army. Thus, at Faiz&acirc;b&acirc;d, the country people
point out a portion of the Queen&rsquo;s highway along which they will
not pass at night. They say that after dark the road is thronged with
troops of headless horsemen, the dead of the army of Prince Sayyid
S&acirc;l&acirc;r. The great host moves on with a noiseless tread; the
ghostly horses make no sound; and no words of command are shouted to
the headless squadrons. Another version comes from Ajmer. There for
some time past a troop of four or five hundred <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>horsemen, armed and dressed in green, issue from
a valley in the neighbourhood of the city, and after riding about for
some time, mysteriously disappear. They are believed to be the escort

Muharram.</p>

<h3 class="main">Mas&acirc;n.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mas&acirc;n, the modern form of the Sanskrit
Smas&acirc;na, &ldquo;a place of cremation,&rdquo; is the general term
for those evil spirits which haunt the place where they were forced to
abandon their tenements of clay. So the modern Italian Lemuri are the
spirits of the churchyard and represent the Lemures or Larv&aelig;, the
unhappy ghosts of those who have died evil deaths or under a ban, to
which there are innumerable allusions in the Latin writers.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4912src" href="#xd21e4912" name=
"xd21e4912src">74</a> In India Mas&acirc;n is very generally regarded
as the ghost of a child, and we have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>already seen that
some tribes regard an infant as a Bh&ucirc;t. He is occasionally the
ghost of a low-caste man, very often that of an oilman, who, possibly
from the dirt which accompanies his trade, is considered ill-omened. By
another account such ghosts prowl about in villages in the Hills in the
form of bears and other wild animals.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4920src" href="#xd21e4920" name="xd21e4920src">75</a> Others say
that Mas&acirc;n is of black and hideous appearance, comes from the
ashes of a funeral pyre, and chases people as they pass by. Some die of
fright from his attacks, others linger for a few days, and some even go
mad. &ldquo;When a person becomes possessed of Mas&acirc;n, the people
invoke the beneficent spirit of the house to come and take possession
of some member of the family, and all begin to dance. At length some
one works himself up into a state of frenzy, and commences to torture
and belabour the body of the person possessed by Mas&acirc;n, until at
length a cure is effected, or the patient perishes under this drastic
treatment.&rdquo; Khabish resembles Mas&acirc;n in his malignant nature
and his fondness for burial grounds. He is also met with in dark glens
and forests in various shapes. Sometimes he imitates the bellow of a
buffalo, or the cry of a goatherd or neatherd, and sometimes he grunts
like a pig. At other times he assumes the disguise of a religious
mendicant and joins travellers on their way; but his conversation is,
like that of ordinary Bh&ucirc;ts, always unintelligible. Like
Mas&acirc;n, he often frightens people and makes them ill, and
sometimes possesses unfortunate travellers who get benighted.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4923src" href="#xd21e4923" name=
"xd21e4923src">76</a></p>
<p>Children afflicted by Mas&acirc;n are said to be &ldquo;under his
shadow&rdquo; (<i>chh&acirc;ya</i>), and waste away by a sort of
consumption. Here we have another instance of the principle already
referred to, that the shadow represents the actual soul.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4931src" href="#xd21e4931" name=
"xd21e4931src">77</a> This malady is believed to be due to some enemy
flinging the ashes from a funeral pyre over the child. The remedy in
such cases is to weigh the child in salt, a well-known demon scarer,
and give it away in charity. The cremation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>ground and the bones and ashes which it contains
are constantly used in various kinds of magical rites. It is believed
when thieves enter a house, that they throw over the inmates some
Mas&acirc;n or ashes from a pyre and make them unconscious while the
robbery is going on. This resembles the English &ldquo;Hand of
Glory,&rdquo; to which reference will be made in another connection. As
to the influence by means of the shadow, it may be noted that a
Nep&acirc;l legend describes how a L&acirc;ma arrested the flight of a
Br&acirc;hman by piercing his shadow with a spear, and the
R&acirc;kshas&icirc; Sinhik&acirc; used to seize the shadow of the
object she desired to devour and so drag the prey into her

in the Hills. According to one account, he is, like the Gay&acirc;l, of
whom we have spoken already, the ghost of a bachelor, and other ghosts
refuse to associate with him; so he is seen only in wild and solitary
places. Others say that he belongs to the class of children ghosts, who
have died too young to undergo the rites of tonsure or cremation. They
are, as a rule, harmless, and are not much dreaded. After a child
undergoes the specified religious ceremonies, its soul is matured, and
fitted either to join the spirits of the sainted dead or to assume a
new existence by transmigration. The estate of the Tola is only
temporary, and after a time, it, too, enters another form of
existence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4944src" href="#xd21e4944" name=

European legend of the Wild Huntsman, who haunts the forest in which he
used to hunt, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=

<p>The companions of Airi are fairies, who, like the Churel, have their
feet turned backwards. He is accompanied by two litter-bearers and a
pack of hounds with bells round their necks. Whoever hears their bark
is certain to meet with calamity. Airi is much given to expectoration,
and his saliva is so venomous that it wounds those on whom it falls.
Incantations must be used and the affected part rubbed with the branch
of a tree. If this be not done at once, the injured man dies, and in
any case he must abstain from rich food for several days. We shall meet
again with the magical power of spittle. Here it may be noted that in
Western folk-lore it confers the power of seeing spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who see Airi face to face are burnt up by the flash of
his eye, or are torn to pieces by his dogs, or have their livers
extracted and eaten by the fairies who accompany him. But should any
one be fortunate enough to survive, the Bh&ucirc;t discloses hidden
treasures to him. The treasure-trove thus disclosed varies in value
from gold coins to old bones. His temples are always in deserted
places. A trident represents the god, and a number of surrounding
stones his followers. He is worshipped once a year by lighting a
bonfire, round which all the people sit. A kettle-drum is played, and
one after another they become possessed, and leap and shout round the
fire. Some brand themselves with heated iron spoons, and sit in the
flames. Those who escape burning are believed to be truly possessed,
while those who are burned are considered mere pretenders <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>to
divine frenzy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4969src" href=
"#xd21e4969" name="xd21e4969src">83</a> This closely resembles the
worship of R&acirc;hu already described.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The revels usually last for about ten nights, and until they
are ended, a lamp is kept burning at the shrine of the god. Those
possessed dye a yard of cloth in red ochre and bind it round their
heads, and carry a wallet in which they place the alms they receive.
While in this state they bathe twice, and eat but once in the
twenty-four hours. They allow no one to touch them, as they consider
other men unclean, and no one but themselves is permitted to touch the
trident and stones in Airi&rsquo;s temple, at least as long as the
festival lasts. The offerings, goats, milk, etc., are consumed by the
worshippers. The kid is marked on the forehead with red, and rice and
water are thrown over him. If he shakes himself to get rid of it, the
god has accepted the offering, whereupon his head is severed with a
knife. If he does not shake himself, or bleats, it is a sign that the
offering is not accepted, and the victim escapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same rule of testing the suitability of the sacrifice prevailed
among the Greeks. The same practice prevails among other tribes. Thus,
the B&acirc;wariyas, when they sacrifice a goat, take a little water in
the palm of the hand and pour it on the nose of the victim. If it
shiver, its head is cut off with a single blow of a sword. The rule has
elsewhere received a further development. Thus when the R&acirc;o of
Cutch sacrifices a buffalo, &ldquo;as it stoops to eat, a few drops of
water are scattered between its horns. If it shake its head it is led
away as displeasing to the goddess; if it nods its head a glittering
scimitar descends on its neck.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">Other Bh&ucirc;ts in the Hills are Acheri, the ghosts
of little girls, who live on the tops of mountains, but descend at
night to hold their revels in more convenient places. To <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>fall
in with their train is fatal, and they have a particular antipathy to
red colour. When little girls fall suddenly ill, the Acheri is supposed
to have cast her shadow over them. The Deo are the regular demons
already described; some are obnoxious to men, some to cattle. The
R&ucirc;niya moves about at night and uses a huge rock as his steed,
the clattering of which announces his approach. He is the demon of the
avalanche and landslip. Should he take a fancy to a woman, she is
haunted by his spirit in her dreams, and gradually wasting away,
finally falls a victim to her passion. He thus resembles the Faun and
the Satyr, the Incubus and Succubus, against whose wiles and
fascination the Roman maiden was warned.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Birth Fiends.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another of these night fiends is the Jilaiya of
Bih&acirc;r, which takes the shape of a night bird, and is able to suck
the blood of any person whose name it hears. Hence women are very
careful not to call their children at night. It is believed that if
this bird fly over the head of a pregnant woman her child will be born
a weakling.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4997src" href="#xd21e4997" name=
"xd21e4997src">86</a></p>
<p>Hence it closely approximates to the birth fiends which beset the
mother and child during the period of impurity after parturition. Thus
the Or&acirc;ons of Chota N&acirc;gpur believe that the fiend Chordevan
comes in the form of a cat and tears the mother&rsquo;s womb.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5002src" href="#xd21e5002" name=
"xd21e5002src">87</a> The Br&acirc;hman, Prabhu, and other high-caste
women of Bombay believe that on the fifth and sixth night after birth
the mother and child are liable to be attacked by the birth spirit
Satv&acirc;&icirc;, who comes in the shape of a cat or a hen.
Consequently they keep a watch in the lying-in room during the whole
night, passing the time in playing, singing and talking to scare the
fiend. The Mar&acirc;thas of N&acirc;sik believe that on the fifth
night, at about twelve o&rsquo;clock, the spirit Sath&icirc;,
accompanied by a male fiend, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href=
"#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>called Burmiya, comes to the
lying-in room, and making the mother insensible, either kills or
disfigures the child. The Vad&acirc;ls of Th&acirc;na think that on the
fifth night the birth spirit Sath&icirc; comes in the form of a cat,
hen, or dog, and devours the heart and skull of the child. They
therefore surround the bed with strands of a creeper, place an iron
knife or scythe on the mother&rsquo;s cot, fire in an iron bickern at
the entrance of the lying-in room, and keep a watch for the night. The
customs all through Northern India are very much of the same type. It
is essential that the fire should be kept constantly burning, lest the
spirit of evil, stepping over the cold ashes, should enter and make its
fatal mark on the forehead of the child. The whole belief turns on the
fear of infantile lockjaw, which is caused by the use of foul
implements in cutting the umbilical cord and the neglect of all
sanitary precautions. It usually comes between the fifth and twelfth
day, and as Satv&acirc;&icirc;, or the Chhath&icirc; of Northern India,
has been raised to the dignity of a goddess. All this is akin to the
belief in fairy changelings and the malignant influences which surround
the European mother and her child.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5007src"

state at least, of exotic origin, though their original basis was
possibly laid on Indian soil. Thus we have the Apsaras, who in name at
least, &ldquo;moving in the water,&rdquo; is akin to Aphrodite. They
appear only faintly in the Veda as the nymphs of Indra&rsquo;s heaven,
and the chief of them is Urvas&icirc;, to whom reference has been
already made. Two of them, Rambh&acirc; and Menak&acirc;, are shown as
luring austere sages from their devotions, as in the Irish legend of
Glendalough. They are the wives or mistresses of the Gandharvas, the
singers and musicians who attend the banquets of the gods. <span class=

appears constantly in the tales of Somadeva, and descends in human form
to the arms of her earthly lovers, as Titania with Bottom in the
&ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream.&rdquo; Their successor in the
modern tales is Sh&acirc;hpasand, &ldquo;The beloved of the
king,&rdquo; who takes the shape of a pigeon and kisses the beautiful
hero. In one of the stories which appears in many forms, the youth with
the help of a Faq&icirc;r finds his way to the dance of R&acirc;ja
Indra, takes the place of his drummer, and wins the fairy, whom he
identifies in spite of the many schemes which the jovial god invents to
deceive him. These ladies are all of surpassing beauty, skilled in
music and the dance, with white skins, and always dressed in red.</p>
<p>With the Jinn we reach a chapter of folk-lore of great extent and
complexity. They are probably in origin closely allied to the
R&acirc;kshasa, Deo and his kindred.<a class="noteref" id=

usually divided into the Jann, who are the least powerful of all the
Jinn, the Shait&acirc;n or Satan of the Hebrews, the Ifr&icirc;t and
the M&acirc;rid, the last of whom rules the rest. The Jann, according
to the Prophet, were created out of a smokeless fire. The Jann is
sometimes identified with the serpent, and sometimes with Ibl&icirc;s,
who has been imported direct from the Greek Diabolos. The Jinn were the
pre-Adamite rulers of the world, and for their sins were overcome by
the angels, taken prisoners and driven to distant islands. They appear
as serpents, lions, wolves or jackals. One kind rules the land, another
the air, a third the sea. There are forty troops of them, each
consisting of six hundred thousand. Some have wings and fly, others
move like snakes and dogs, others go about like men. They are of
gigantic stature, sometimes resplendently handsome, sometimes horridly
hideous. They can become invisible and move on earth when they please.
Sometimes one of them is shut up in a jar under the seal of the Lord
Solomon who rules them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href=

<h3 class="main">The Ghoul.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Besides these there is a host of minor demons, such as
the Gh&ucirc;l, the English Ghoul, who is a kind of Shait&acirc;n, eats
men, and is variously described as a Jinn or as an enchanter. By one
tradition, when the Shait&acirc;n attempt by stealth to hear the words
of men, they are struck by shooting stars, some are burnt, some fall
into the sea and become crocodiles, and some fall upon the land and
become Gh&ucirc;ls. The Gh&ucirc;l is properly a female, and the male
is Qutrub. They are the offspring of Ibl&icirc;s and his wife. The
Sil&acirc;t or Sil&acirc; lives in forests, and when it captures a man
makes him dance and plays with him, as the cat plays with the mouse.
Similar to this creature is the Ghadd&acirc;r, who tortures and
terrifies men, the Dalh&acirc;m, who is in the form of a man and rides
upon an ostrich, and the Shiqq or Nasn&acirc;s, who are ogres and
vampires. But these are little known in Indian folk-lore, except that
directly imported from Arabic sources.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">The Baghaut.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As an instance of the respect paid to the ghosts of
those who have perished by an untimely death, we may mention the
Baghaut. According to the last census returns some eight thousand
persons recorded themselves as worshippers in the North-Western
Provinces of Bagahu or Sapaha, the ghosts of people killed by tigers or
snakes. The Baghaut is usually erected on the place where a man was
killed by a tiger, but it sometimes merges into the common form of
shrine, as in a case given by Dr. Buchanan, where a person received the
same honour because he had been killed by the aboriginal Kols.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5040src" href="#xd21e5040" name=
"xd21e5040src">92</a> The shrine is generally a heap of stones or
branches <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>near some pathway in the jungle. Every passer-by
adds to the pile, which is in charge of the Baiga or aboriginal priest,
who offers upon it a pig, or a cock, or some spirits, and lights a
little lamp there occasionally. Many such shrines are to be found in
the Mirzapur jungles. In the Central Provinces they are known as
P&acirc;t, a term applied in Chota N&acirc;gpur to holy heights
dedicated to various divinities.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5045src"
href="#xd21e5045" name="xd21e5045src">93</a> They are usually erected
in a place where a man has been killed by a tiger or by a snake;
sometimes no reason whatever is given for their selection. &ldquo;In
connection with these shrines they have a special ceremony for laying
the ghost of a tiger. Until it is gone through, neither Gond nor Baiga
will go into the jungles if he can help it, as they say not only does
the spirit of the dead man walk, but the tiger is also possessed, for
the nonce, with an additional spirit of evil (by the soul of the dead
man entering into him) which increases his power of intelligence and
ferocity, rendering him more formidable than usual, and more eager to
pursue his natural enemy, man. Some of the Baigas are supposed to be
gifted with great powers of witchcraft, and it is common for a Baiga
medicine man to be called in to bewitch the tigers and prevent them
carrying off the village cattle. The Gonds thoroughly believe in the
powers of these men.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5048src" href=
"#xd21e5048" name="xd21e5048src">94</a></p>
<p>I myself came across a singular instance of this some time ago. I
was asking a Baiga of the Chero tribe what he could do in this way, but
I found him singularly reticent on the subject. I asked the
Superintendent of the Dudhi Estate, who was with me, to explain the
reason. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;when I came here first
many years ago, a noted Baiga came to me and proposed to do some
witchcraft to protect me from tigers, which were very numerous in the
neighbourhood at the time. I told him that I could look after myself,
and advised him to do the same. That night a tiger seized the wretched
Baiga while he was on his way home, and all that was found of him were
some scraps of cloth and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>pieces of bone. Since then I
notice that the Baigas of these parts do not talk so loudly of their
power of managing tigers when I am present.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Churel.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">More dreaded even than the ghost of a man who has been
killed by a tiger is the Churel, a name which has been connected with
that of the Ch&ucirc;hra or sweeper caste. The ghosts of all low-caste
people are notoriously malignant, an idea which possibly arises from
their connection with the aboriginal faith, which was treated half with
fear and half with contempt by their conquerors. The corpses of such
people are either cremated or buried face downwards, in order to
prevent the evil spirit from escaping and troubling its neighbours. So,
it was the old custom in Great Britain in order to prevent the spirit
of a suicide from &ldquo;walking&rdquo; and becoming a terror to the
neighbourhood, to turn the coffin upside down and thrust a spear
through it and the body which it contained so as to fix it to the
ground.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5060src" href="#xd21e5060" name=
"xd21e5060src">95</a> Riots have taken place and the authority of the
magistrates has been invoked to prevent a sweeper from being buried in
the ordinary way.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5063src" href="#xd21e5063"
name="xd21e5063src">96</a></p>
<p>The Churel, who corresponds to the Jakh&acirc;&icirc;,
Jokh&acirc;&icirc;, Muk&acirc;&icirc;, or Naval&acirc;&icirc; of
Bombay,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5068src" href="#xd21e5068" name=
"xd21e5068src">97</a> is the ghost of a woman dying while pregnant, or
on the day of the child&rsquo;s birth, or within the prescribed period
of impurity. The superstition is based on the horror felt by all
savages at the blood, or even touch of a woman who is ceremonially
impure.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5071src" href="#xd21e5071" name=
"xd21e5071src">98</a> The idea is, it is needless to say, common in
India. The woman in her menses is kept carefully apart, and is not
allowed to do cooking or any domestic work until she has undergone the
purification by bathing and changing her garments. Some of the
Dr&acirc;vidian tribes refuse to allow a woman in this condition to
touch the house-thatch, and she is obliged to creep through
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>a narrow hole in the back wall whenever she has
to leave the house. Hence, too, the objection felt by men to walk under
walls or balconies where women may be seated and thus convey the
pollution. From Kulu, on the slopes of the Him&acirc;layas, a custom is
reported which is probably connected with this principle and with the
rules of the Couvade, to which reference will be made later on. When a
woman who is pregnant dies, her husband is supposed to have committed
some sin, and he is deemed unclean for a time. He turns a Faq&icirc;r
and goes on pilgrimage for a month or so, and, having bathed in some
sacred place, is re-admitted into caste. The woman is buried, the child
having been first removed from her body by one of the D&acirc;gi caste,
and her death is not considered a natural one under any
circumstances.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5076src" href="#xd21e5076"
name="xd21e5076src">99</a></p>
<p>The Churel is particularly malignant to her own family. She appears
in various forms. Sometimes she is fair in front and black behind, but
she invariably has her feet turned round, heels in front and toes
behind. The same idea prevails in many other places. The Gira, a
water-spirit of the Konkan, has his feet turned backwards.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5081src" href="#xd21e5081" name=
"xd21e5081src">100</a> In the Teignmouth story of the Devil he leaves
his backward footsteps in the snow. Pliny so describes Anthropophagi of
Mount Im&oelig;us, and Megasthenes speaks of a similar race on Mount
Nilo.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5084src" href="#xd21e5084" name=
"xd21e5084src">101</a></p>
<p>She generally, however, assumes the form of a beautiful young woman
and seduces youths at night, especially those who are good-looking. She
carries them off to some kingdom of her own, and if they venture to eat
the food offered to them there, she keeps them till they lose their
manly beauty and then sends them back to the world grey-haired old men,
who, like Rip Van Winkle, find all their friends dead long ago.</p>
<p>So the Lady of the Lake won Merlin to her arms.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5091src" href="#xd21e5091" name="xd21e5091src">102</a> The
same idea prevails in Italy, but there the absence is only temporary.
&ldquo;Among the wizards and witches are even <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>princes and princesses, who to conceal their
debauchery and dishonour take the goat form and carry away partners for
the dance, bearing them upon their backs, and so they fly many miles in
a few minutes, and go with them to distant cities and other places,
where they feast, dance, drink, and make love. But when day approaches
they carry their partners home again, and when they wake they think
they have had pleasant dreams. But indeed their diversion was more real
than they supposed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5096src" href=
"#xd21e5096" name="xd21e5096src">103</a> So, the Manxmen tell of a man
who was absent from his people for four years, which he spent with the
fairies. He could not tell how he returned, but it seemed as if, having
been unconscious, he woke up at last in this world.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5099src" href="#xd21e5099" name="xd21e5099src">104</a> I had a
smart young butler at Etah, who once described to me vividly the narrow
escape he had from the fascinations of a Churel, who lived on a
P&icirc;pal tree near the cemetery. He saw her sitting on the wall in
the dusk and entered into conversation with her; but he fortunately
observed her tell-tale feet and escaped. He would never go again by
that road without an escort. So, the fairies of England and Ireland
look with envy on the beautiful boys and girls, and carry them off to
fairyland, where they keep them till youth and beauty have
departed.</p>

<h3 class="main">Eating Food in Spirit Land.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The consequences of rashly eating the food of the
underworld are well known. The reason is that eating together implies
kinship with the dwellers in the land of spirits, and he who does so
never returns to the land of men.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5108src"
href="#xd21e5108" name="xd21e5108src">105</a></p>
<p>The Churel superstition appears in other forms. Thus, the Korwas of
Mirzapur say that if a woman dies in the delivery-room, she becomes a
Churel, but they do not know, or do not care to say, what finally
becomes of her. The Pat&acirc;ris and Majhw&acirc;rs think that if a
woman dies within the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>period of pregnancy or
uncleanness, she becomes a Churel. She appears in the form of a pretty
little girl in white clothes, and seduces them away to the mountains,
until the Baiga is called in to sacrifice a goat and release her
victim. The Bhuiy&acirc;rs go further and say that little baby girls
who die before they are twenty days old become Churels. They live in
stones in the mountains and cause pain to men. The remedy is for the
afflicted one to put some rice and barley on his head, turn round two
or three times, and shake off the grain in the direction of the jungle,
when she releases her victim. The idea seems to be that with these holy
grains, which are scarers of demons, the evil influence is dispersed.
But she continues to visit him, and requires propitiation. Among these
people the Churel has been very generally enrolled among the regular
village godlings and resides with them in the common village shrine,
where she receives her share of the periodical offerings. Any one who
sees a Churel is liable to be attacked by a wasting disease, and, as in
the case of the D&ucirc;nd, to answer her night summons brings
death.</p>

<h3 class="main">Modes of Repelling the Churel.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are fortunately various remedies which are
effective in preventing a woman who dies under these circumstances from
becoming a Churel. One way is that practised by the Majhw&acirc;rs of
Mirzapur, which resembles that for laying the evil spirit of a sweeper,
to which reference has been made already. They do not cremate the body,
but bury it, fill the grave with thorns and pile heavy stones above to
keep down the ghost.</p>
<p>Among the Bhand&acirc;ris of Bengal, when a pregnant woman dies
before delivery, her body is cut open and the child taken out, both
corpses being buried in the same grave.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5122src" href="#xd21e5122" name="xd21e5122src">106</a> In Bombay,
when a woman dies in pregnancy, her corpse, after being bathed and
decked with flowers and ornaments, is carried to the burning ground.
There her husband <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273"
name="pb273">273</a>]</span>sprinkles water on her body from the points
of a wisp of the sacred Darbha grass and repeats holy verses. Then he
cuts her right side with a sharp weapon and takes out the child. Should
it be alive, it is taken home and cared for; should it be dead, it is
then and there buried. The hole in the side of the corpse is filled
with curds and butter, covered with cotton threads, and then the usual
rite of cremation is carried out.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5127src"
href="#xd21e5127" name="xd21e5127src">107</a> In one of the tales of
Somadeva, Saktideva cuts the child out of his pregnant wife.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5130src" href="#xd21e5130" name=
"xd21e5130src">108</a></p>
<p>In the Hills, if a woman dies during the menstrual period or in
childbirth, the corpse is anointed with the five products of the cow,
and special texts are recited. A small quantity of fire is then placed
on the chest of the corpse, which is either buried or thrown into
flowing water.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5135src" href="#xd21e5135"
name="xd21e5135src">109</a> Here we have the three great
demon-scarers,&mdash;fire, earth and water, combined. In another
device, iron, which has similar virtue, is used. Small round-headed
iron spikes, specially made for the purpose, are driven into the nails
of the four fingers of the corpse, while the thumbs and great toes are
securely fastened together with iron rings. Most Hindus, it may be
remarked, tie the corpse to the bier, whatever may have been the cause
of death, and in parts of Ireland a thread is tied round the toe of the
corpse, the object apparently being to secure the body and prevent an
evil spirit from entering it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5138src" href=
"#xd21e5138" name="xd21e5138src">110</a></p>
<p>In the Hills the place where a pregnant woman died is carefully
scraped and the earth removed. The spot is then sown with mustard,
which is sprinkled along the road traversed by the corpse on its way to
the burial ground. The reason given for this is twofold. First, the
mustard blossoms in the world of the dead, and its sweet smell pleases
the spirit and keeps her content, so that she does not long to revisit
her earthly home; secondly, the Churel rises from her grave at
nightfall and seeks to return to her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>friends; she sees the
minute grains of the mustard scattered abroad and stoops to pick it up,
and while so engaged cock-crow comes, she is unable to visit her home,
and must return to her grave. This is another instance of the rule that
evil spirits move about only at night.</p>

<p class="first">This counting of the grains of mustard illustrates
another principle which is thus explained by Mr. Leland:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5150src" href="#xd21e5150" name=
"xd21e5150src">111</a> &ldquo;A traveller in Persia has observed that
the patterns of carpets are made intricate, so that the Evil Eye,
resting upon them and following the design, loses its power. This was
the motive of all the interlaces of the Celtic and Norse designs. When
the witch sees the S&acirc;lagr&acirc;ma, her glance is at once
bewildered with its holes and veins. As I have elsewhere remarked, the
herb Rosaloaccio, not the corn poppy, but a kind of small house leek,
otherwise called &lsquo;Rice of the Goddess of the four Winds,&rsquo;
derives its name from looking, ere it unfolds, like confused grains of
rice, and when a witch sees it she cannot enter till she has counted
them, which is impossible; therefore it is used to protect rooms from
witchcraft.&rdquo; Sarson or mustard is, it may be noted, used as a
scarer of demons. In all the principal Hindu ceremonies in Western
India, grains of Sarshapa or Sarson (<i>Sinapts dichotoma</i>) and
parched rice are scattered about to scare fiends. Akbar used to have
Sipand or Sarson burnt on a hot plate to keep off the Evil
Eye&mdash;<i>Nazar-i-bad</i>&mdash;from his valuable horses.<a class=

<h3 class="main">The Couvade.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In connection with this subject of parturition
impurity, the very remarkable custom of the Couvade may be referred to
here. This is the rule by which at the birth of a child <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>the
father is treated as an invalid, instead of or in addition to the
mother:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">When Chineses go to bed,</p>
<p class="line">And lie in in their ladies&rsquo; stead.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Marco Polo, writing of Zardandan, gives a good
example:&mdash;&ldquo;When one of their wives has been delivered of a
child, the infant is washed and swathed, and then the woman gets up and
goes about her household affairs, whilst the husband takes to bed with
the child by his side, and so keeps his bed for forty days; and all the
kith and kin come to visit her, and keep up a great festivity. They do
this because they say the woman has had a bad time of it, and it is but
fair that the man should have a share of suffering.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5184src" href="#xd21e5184" name=
"xd21e5184src">114</a> Professor Rhys remarks that the gods of Celtic
Ireland used to practise the Couvade.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5187src" href="#xd21e5187" name="xd21e5187src">115</a></p>
<p>Professor Max M&uuml;ller thinks that it is clear that the poor
husband was at first tyrannized over by his female relations and
afterwards frightened into superstition. He then began to make a martyr
of himself, till he made himself really ill, or took to bed in
self-defence. The custom appears, however, to rest on a much more
primitive set of ideas. It partly implies, perhaps, the transition from
that social state in which, owing to the laxity of the connection
between the sexes, the only recognized form of descent was through the
mother, and partly, the kindred conception that the father has more to
do with the production of the child than the mother, and that the
father must, at the critical period of the baby&rsquo;s existence,
exercise particular caution that through his negligence no demoniacal
influence may assail the infant,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5192src"
href="#xd21e5192" name="xd21e5192src">116</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is curious that in India itself so few actual instances of the
Couvade have been discovered. This, however, as Mr. Hartland shows, is
not unusual, and the Couvade is not found in the lowest stage of
savagery. But that the custom once generally prevailed is quite
certain, and in Northern India, at least, it seems to have been masked
by special birth ceremonies of great stringency and elaborate detail,
but of distinctly later date than the very primitive usage with which
we are now concerned.</p>
<p>One instance of the actual Couvade is given by Professor Sir
Monier-Williams.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5202src" href="#xd21e5202"
name="xd21e5202src">117</a> Among a very low caste of basket-makers in
Gujar&acirc;t, it is the usual practice for a wife to go about her work
immediately after delivery, as if nothing had occurred. &ldquo;The
presiding Mother (M&acirc;t&acirc;) of the tribe is supposed to
transfer the weakness to her husband, who takes to his bed and has to
be supported for several days with good nourishing food.&rdquo; Again,
among the Kols of Chota N&acirc;gpur, father and mother are considered
impure for eight days, during which period the members of the family
are sent out of the house, and the husband has to cook for his wife. If
it be a difficult case of parturition, the malignancy of some spirit of
evil is supposed to be at work, and after divination to ascertain his
name, a sacrifice is made to appease him.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5208src" href="#xd21e5208" name="xd21e5208src">118</a> Among many
of the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes of Mirzapur, when the posset or spiced
drink is prepared for the mother after her confinement, the father is
obliged to drink the first sup of it. Among all these people, the
father does not work or leave the house during the period of
parturition impurity, and cooks for his wife. When asked why he
refrains from work, they simply say that he is so pleased with the
safety of his wife and the birth of his child, that he takes a holiday;
but some survival of the Couvade is probably at the root of the custom.
The same idea prevails in a modified form in Bombay. The Pomaliyas,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>gold-washers of South Gujar&acirc;t, after a
birth, take great care of the husband, give him food, and do not allow
him to go out; and &ldquo;when a child is born to a Deshasth
Br&acirc;hman, he throws himself into a well with all his clothes on,
and, in the presence of his wife&rsquo;s relations, lets a couple of
drops of honey and butter fall into the mouth of the
child.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5213src" href="#xd21e5213"

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Various Birth Ceremonies.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The same idea that the infant is likely to receive
demoniacal influences through its father appears to be the explanation
of another class of birth ceremonies. In Northern India, in respectable
families, the father does not look on the child until the astrologer
selects a favourable moment. If the birth occur in the unlucky lunar
asterism of M&ucirc;l, the father is often not allowed to see his child
for years, and has in addition to undergo an elaborate rite of
purification, known as M&ucirc;la-s&acirc;nti. So, in Bombay,
&ldquo;the Belgaum Chitpavans do not allow the father to look on the
new-born child, but at its reflection in butter. The Dharw&acirc;r
Radders do not allow the father to see the lamp being waved round the
image of Satv&acirc;&icirc;, the birth goddess. If the father sees it,
it is believed that the mother and child will sicken. The
Karn&acirc;tak Jainas allow anyone to feed the new-born babe with honey
and castor oil, except the father. Among the Beni Isr&acirc;els, when
the boy is being circumcised, the father sits apart covered with a
veil. Among the P&ucirc;na Musalm&acirc;ns, friends are called to eat
the goat offered as a sacrifice on the birth of a child. All join in
the feast except the parents, who may not eat the
sacrifice.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5221src" href="#xd21e5221"
name="xd21e5221src">120</a> Probably on the same principle, among most
of the lower castes, the father and mother do not eat on the wedding
day of their children until the ceremony is over.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All deserts, also, are a resort of Bh&ucirc;ts, as the
great desert of Lop, where Marco Polo assures us they are constantly
seen at night. In the Western Panj&acirc;b deserts, during the prairie
fires and in the dead of night, the lonely herdsmen used to hear cries
arising from the ground, and shouts of <i>M&acirc;r! M&acirc;r!</i>
&ldquo;Strike! Strike!&rdquo; which were ascribed to the spirits of men
who had been killed in former frontier raids. Such supernatural sounds
were heard by the early settlers within the last fifty years, and,
until quite recently, the people were afraid to travel without forming
large parties for fear of encountering the supernatural enemies who
frequented these uninhabited tracts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5255src" href="#xd21e5255" name="xd21e5255src">121</a> So, among
the Mirzapur jungle tribes, the wild forests of Sarguja are supposed to
be infested with Bh&ucirc;ts, and if any one goes there rashly he is
attacked through their influence with diarrh&oelig;a and vomiting. The
site of the present British Residency at Kathm&acirc;ndu in Nep&acirc;l
was specially selected by the Nep&acirc;lese as it was a barren patch,
supposed to be the abode of demons. So, in Scotland, the local spirit
lives in a patch of untilled ground, known as the

<p class="first">The Strix, or screech owl, in Roman folk-lore was
supposed to suck the blood of young children. Another form of the word
in Latin is Striga, meaning a hag or witch. The Lilith of the Jews, the
&ldquo;night monster&rdquo; of our latest version of the Old Testament,
becomes in the Rabbinical stories Adam&rsquo;s first wife, &ldquo;the
Queen of demons&rdquo; and murderess of young children, who is the
&ldquo;night hag&rdquo; of Milton.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5281src"
href="#xd21e5281" name="xd21e5281src">124</a></p>
<p>The Kumaun owl legend is that they had originally no plumes of their
own, and were forced to borrow those of their neighbours, who pursue
them if they find them abroad at daylight. Owl&rsquo;s flesh is a
powerful love philter, and the eating of it causes a man to become a
fool and to lose his memory; hence, women give it to their husbands,
that as a result of the mental weakness which it produces they may be
able to carry on their flirtations with impunity. On the other hand,
the owl is the type of wisdom, and eating the eyeballs of an owl gives
the power of seeing in the dark, an excellent example of sympathetic
magic. If you put an owl in a room, go in naked, shut the door and feed
the bird with meat all night, you acquire magical powers. I once had a
native clerk who was supposed to have gone through this ordeal, and was
much feared accordingly. Here we have another instance of the nudity
charm. In the same way in Gujar&acirc;t, if a man takes seven cotton
threads, goes to a place where an owl is hooting, strips naked, ties a
knot at each hoot, and fastens the thread round the right arm of a
fever patient, the fever goes away.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5286src"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To return to the connection of ghosts with burial
grounds. At Bishesar in the Hills, the Hindu dead from Almora are
burnt. The spirits of the departed are supposed to lurk there and are
occasionally seen. Sometimes, under the guidance of their leader
Bholan&acirc;th, whom we have mentioned already, they come, some in
palanquins and some on foot, at night, to the Almora B&acirc;z&acirc;r
and visit the merchants&rsquo; shops. Death is supposed to follow soon
on a meeting with their processions. These ghosts are supposed to be
deficient in some of their members. One has no head, another no feet,
and so on; but they can all talk and dance.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Mutilation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This illustrates another principle about ghosts, that
mutilation during life is avoided, as being likely to turn the spirit
into a malignant ghost after death. This is the reason that many
savages keep the cuttings of their hair and nails, not only to put them
out of the way of witches, who might work evil charms by their means,
but also that the body when it rises at the Last Day may not be
deficient in any part.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5304src" href=
"#xd21e5304" name="xd21e5304src">127</a> This also explains the strong
feeling among Hindus against decapitation as a form of execution, and
the dread which Musalm&acirc;ns exhibit towards cremation. It also, in
all probability, explains the lame demons, which abound all the world
over, like Hephaistos, Wayland Smith, the Persian &AElig;shma, the
Asmodeus of the book of Tobit, and the Club-footed Devil of
Christianity. The prejudice against amputation, based on this idea, is
one of the many difficulties which meet our surgeons in India.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ghosts of Old Ruins.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another place where ghosts, as might have been
expected, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>resort is in old ruins. Many old buildings are,
as we have seen, attributed to the agency of demons, and in any case
interference with them is resented by the <i>Deus loci</i> who occupies
them. This explains the number of old ruined houses which one sees in
an Indian town, and with which no one cares to meddle, as they are
occupied by the spirits of their former owners. The same idea extends
to the large bricks of the ancient buildings which are occasionally
disinterred. Dr. Buchanan describes how on one occasion no one would
assist him in digging out an ancient stone image. The people told him
that a man who had made an attempt to do so some time before had met
with sudden death.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5320src" href=
"#xd21e5320" name="xd21e5320src">128</a> The landlord of the village
stated that he would gladly use the bricks from these ruins, but that
he was afraid of the consequences. So, in Bombay, interference with the
bricks of an ancient dam brought Guinea worm and dysentery into a
village, and some labourers were cut off who meddled with some ancient
tombs at Ahmadnagar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5323src" href=
"#xd21e5323" name="xd21e5323src">129</a> General Cunningham, in one of
his Reports, describes how on one occasion, when carrying on some
excavations, his elephant escaped, and was recovered with difficulty;
the people unanimously attributed the disaster to the vengeance of the
local ghosts, who resented his proceedings. The people who live in the
neighbourhood of the old city of Sahet Mahet are, for the same reason,
very unwilling to meddle with its ruins, or even to enter it at night.
When Mr. Benett was there, a storm which occurred was generally
believed to be a token of the displeasure of the spirits at his
intrusion on their domains.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5326src" href=
"#xd21e5326" name="xd21e5326src">130</a> The tomb of Shaikh M&icirc;na
Sh&acirc;h at Lucknow was demolished during the Mutiny, and the workmen
suffered so much trouble from the wrath of the saint, that when the
disturbances were over they collected and rebuilt it at their own
expense.</p>
<p>The same theory exists in other countries. Thus, in the Isle of Man,
&ldquo;a good Manx scholar told me how a relative of his had carted the
earth from an old burial ground on his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>farm and used it as
manure for his fields, and how his beasts died afterwards. It is
possible for a similar reason that a house in ruins is seldom pulled
down and the materials used for other buildings; where that has been
done misfortunes have ensued.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5333src" href="#xd21e5333" name="xd21e5333src">131</a></p>
<p>In the Konkan it is believed that all treasures buried underground,
all the mines of gold, silver, and precious stones, all old caves and
all ruined fortresses, are guarded by underground spirits in the shape
of a hairy serpent or frog. These spirits never leave their places, and
they attack and injure only those persons who come to remove the things
which they are guarding.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5338src" href=
"#xd21e5338" name="xd21e5338src">132</a> In short, these places are
like the Sith Bhruaith mounds in Scotland, which were respected, and it
was deemed unlawful and dangerous to cut wood, dig earth there, or
otherwise disturb them. In the same way the sites of ancient villages
which abound in Northern India are more or less respected. They were
abandoned on account of the ravages of war, famine, or pestilence, and
are guarded by the spirits of the original owners, these calamities
being self-evident proofs of the malignity and displeasure of the local
deities.</p>

Korwas of Chota N&acirc;gpur, their bloodthirsty deity has a cave for
her residence. Mah&acirc;deva, say the Gonds, shut up the founders of
their race in a cave in the Him&acirc;layas, but Lingo removed the
stone and released sixteen crores of Gonds. Tal&acirc;o Daitya, a noted
demon of K&acirc;thi&acirc;w&acirc;r, lives in a cave where a lamp is
lit which never goes out, however violently the wind may blow or the
rain may fall. Saptasr&icirc; Dev&icirc;, a much dreaded spirit in the
Konkan, lives in a cave; such is also the case with the eight-armed
Dev&icirc; at Asthbhuja, in the Mirzapur District. Her devotees have to
creep through a narrow passage into what is now the shrine of the
goddess, but is said to have been, and very probably was, a
cave.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5390src" href="#xd21e5390" name=
"xd21e5390src">139</a></p>
<p>When the Korwas of Mirzapur have to enter a cave, they first arm
themselves with a rude spear and axe as a protection against
Bh&ucirc;ts. There are two haunted caves in the Mircha and Banka Hills
in Sarguja. The Mircha cave is inhabited by a demon called
Mah&acirc;d&acirc;ni Deo, who is much feared. Not even a Baiga can
enter this cave, but many of them have seen his white horse tied up
near the entrance, and green grass and horsedung lying there. In the
cave on the Banka Hill lives a D&acirc;no, whose name either no one
knows or dares to tell. No one ventures to enter his cave, and he
worries people in dreams and brings sickness, unless a Baiga
periodically offers a cock with black and white feathers below the
cave, makes a fire sacrifice and throws some grains of rice in the
direction of the mountain. When this Deo is enraged, a noise which
sounds like <i>Gudgud! Gudgud!</i> comes from the cave. He is also
heard shouting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>at night, and when cholera is coming he calls
out <i>Khabard&acirc;r! Khabard&acirc;r!</i> &ldquo;Be cautious! Be
cautious!&rdquo; Any one who goes near the cave gets diarrh&oelig;a.
Captain Younghusband has recently solved the mystery of the famous Lamp
Rock cave of Central Asia, which is simply the light coming through a
concealed aperture at the rear of the entrance.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5403src" href="#xd21e5403" name="xd21e5403src">140</a></p>
<p>Many caves, again, have acquired their sanctity by being occupied by
famous Hindu and Muhammadan saints. Such are some of the Buddhistic
caves found in many places, which are now occupied by their successors
of other faiths. There is a cave at Bhuili, in the Mirzapur District,
which has a very narrow entrance, but miraculously expands to
accommodate any possible number of pilgrims. They say that when the
saint Sal&icirc;m Chishti came to visit Sh&acirc;h Vil&acirc;yat at
Agra, the stone seat in front of the mosque of the latter was large
enough to accommodate only one person, but when Sal&icirc;m Chishti sat
on it its length was miraculously doubled.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5408src" href="#xd21e5408" name="xd21e5408src">141</a></p>
<p>These cave spirits are common in European folk-lore. Such are the
Buccas and Knockers of the Cornwall mines,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5413src" href="#xd21e5413" name="xd21e5413src">142</a> and the
Kobolds of Germany. Falstaff speaks of &ldquo;learning, a mere hoard of
gold kept by a devil.&rdquo; Burton thus sums up the matter:
&ldquo;Subterraneous devils are as common as the rest, and do as much
harm. These (saith Munster) are commonly seen among mines of metals,
and are some of them noxious; some, again, do no harm. The metal men in
many places account it good luck, a sign of treasure and rich ore, when
they see them. Georgius Agricola reckons two more notable kinds of
them, Getuli and Kobali; both are clothed after the manner of mortal
men, and will many times imitate their works. Their office is, as
Pictorius and Paracelsus think, to keep treasure in the earth, that it
be not all at once revealed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5416src"

<h3 class="main">Bh&ucirc;ts Treasure Guardians.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This leads us to the common idea that Bh&ucirc;ts,
like the Cornwall Spriggans,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5426src" href=
"#xd21e5426" name="xd21e5426src">144</a> guard treasure. Ill luck very
often attaches to treasure-trove. Some years ago a Cham&acirc;r dug up
some treasure in the ancient fort of Atranji Khera in the Etah
District. He did his best to purge himself of the ill luck attaching to
it by giving away a large portion in charity. But he died a beggar, and
the whole country-side attributes his ruin to the anger of the
Bh&ucirc;ts who guarded the treasure. Some time ago an old man came
into my court at Mirzapur and gave up two old brass pots, which he had
found while ploughing about a year before. Since then he had suffered a
succession of troubles, and his son, who was with him when he found the
property, died. He then called a conference of sorcerers to consider
the matter, and they advised him to appease the Bh&ucirc;t by giving up
the treasure. He further remarked that the Sark&acirc;r or Government
doubtless knew some Mantra or charm which would prevent any harm to it
from taking over such dangerous property. Occasionally, however, the
Bh&ucirc;t is worsted, as in a Kumaun tale, where an old man and his
daughter-in-law tie up a Bh&ucirc;t and make him give up five jars full
of gold.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5432src" href="#xd21e5432" name=
"xd21e5432src">145</a></p>
<p>Treasure is often thus kept guarded in sacred caves. In Jaynagar is
said to be the treasury of Indradyumna, sealed with a magic seal. He
was king of Avanti, who set up the image of Jagann&acirc;tha in Orissa.
The spot presents the appearance of a plain smooth rock, which has been
perhaps artificially smoothed. It is said that Indradyumna had a great
warrior, whom he fully trusted and raised to the highest honours. At
last this man began to entertain the idea of asking his master&rsquo;s
daughter in marriage. The king, hearing this, was sorely wroth, but his
dependent was too powerful to be easily subdued. So he contrived that a
cavern should be excavated, and here he removed all his treasure, and
when all was secured he invited the warrior to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>the
place. The man unsuspectingly went in, when Indradyumna let fall the
trap-door and sealed it with his magic seal; but he was punished for
his wickedness by defeat at the hands of the Muhammadans.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5439src" href="#xd21e5439" name=
"xd21e5439src">146</a></p>
<p>In Ireland the Leprehaun, a little cobbler who sits under the hedge
and whose tapping as he mends his shoes may be heard in the soft summer
twilight, is a guardian of treasure, and if any one can seize him he
will give a pot of gold to secure his escape.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Fairy Gifts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In connection with these treasure guardians, we reach
another cycle of folk-lore legends, that of gifts or robberies from
fairy-land. Professor Rhys, writing of the Celts, well explains the
principle on which these are based.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5452src"
href="#xd21e5452" name="xd21e5452src">148</a> &ldquo;The Celts, in
common with all other peoples of Aryan race, regarded all their
domestic comforts as derived by them from their ancestors in the
forgotten past, that is to say from the departed. They seem, therefore,
to have argued that there must be a land of untold wealth and bliss
somewhere in the nether world inhabited by their dead ancestors; and
the further inference would be that the things they most valued in life
had been procured from the leaders of that nether world through fraud
or force by some great benefactor of the human race; for it seldom
seems to have entered their minds that the powers below would give up
anything for nothing.&rdquo; Hence the many tales which thus account
for the bringing of fire and other blessings to man.</p>
<p>Of the same type are the usual tales of the fairy gifts. Thus, in
one version from Patna we read that one day a corpse came floating down
the river, and a Faq&icirc;r announced that this was Ch&acirc;n
H&acirc;ji. He was duly buried and honoured, and in many places he used
to keep silver and gold vessels for the use of travellers. If anyone
wanted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>a vessel, he had only to say so, and one used to
float out of the water. But a covetous man appropriated one, and since
then the supply has ceased.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5459src" href=
"#xd21e5459" name="xd21e5459src">149</a> The same legend is told of the
great Karsota lake in Mirzapur, and of numbers of others all over the
country. The culprit is generally a Banya, or corn-chandler, the type
of sneaking greediness. The same story appears constantly in European
folk-lore, as is shown by Mr. Hartland&rsquo;s admirable
summary.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5462src" href="#xd21e5462" name=
"xd21e5462src">150</a></p>
<p>Another version current in India also corresponds with the Western
tradition. This is where a person receives a gift from the fairies,
which he does not appreciate, and so loses. Thus, in a tale from
R&acirc;&ecirc;pur, in the Central Provinces, the goatherd used to
watch a strange goat, which joined his flock. One day it walked into
the tank and disappeared. While the goatherd was looking on in wonder,
a stone was thrown to him from the water, and a voice exclaimed,
&ldquo;This is the reward of your labour.&rdquo; The disappointed
goatherd knocked the stone back into the water with his axe. But he
found that his axe had been changed by the touch into gold. He searched
for the stone, but could never find it again.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5467src" href="#xd21e5467" name="xd21e5467src">151</a></p>
<p>In another tale of the same kind, the cowherd tends the cow of the
fairy, and, following the animal into a cave, receives some golden
wheat. In a third version, the fool throws away a handful of golden
barley, and only comes to know of his mistake when his wife finds that
some fuel cakes, on which he had laid his blanket, had turned into
gold.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5472src" href="#xd21e5472" name=
"xd21e5472src">152</a> So, at Pathari, in Bhop&acirc;l, there lived a
Muni, or a P&icirc;r, in a cave unknown to any one. His goat used to
graze with the herdsman&rsquo;s flock. The shepherd, one day, followed
the goat into the cave and found an old man sitting intent in
meditation. He made a noise to attract the saint&rsquo;s attention, who
asked the object of his visit. The herdsman asked for wages, whereupon
the saint gave him a handful of barley. He took it home, and, in
disgust, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>threw it on fire, where his wife soon after
found it turned into gold. The herdsman went back to thank the old man,
but found the cave deserted, and its occupant was never heard of again.
The shepherd devoted the wealth, thus miraculously acquired, to
building a temple.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5477src" href=

<h3 class="main">Underground Treasure.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This underground kingdom, stored with untold treasure,
appears in other tales. Thus, K&acirc;fir Kot, like many other places
of the same kind, is supposed to have underground galleries holding
untold treasures. One day a man is said to have entered an opening,
where he found a flight of steps. Going down the steps, he came to
rooms filled with many valuable things. Selecting a few, he turned to
go, but he found the entrance closed. On dropping the treasure the door
opened again, and it shut when he again tried to take something with
him. According to another version he lost his sight when he touched the
magic wealth, and it was restored when he surrendered the
treasure.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5485src" href="#xd21e5485" name=
"xd21e5485src">154</a></p>
<p>Another tale of the same kind is preserved by the old Buddhist
traveller, Hwen Thsang.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5490src" href=
"#xd21e5490" name="xd21e5490src">155</a> There was a herdsman who
tended his cattle near Bh&acirc;galpur. One day a bull separated from
the rest of the herd and roamed into the forest. The herdsman feared
that the animal was lost, but in the evening he returned radiant with
beauty. Even his lowing was so remarkable that the rest of the cattle
feared to approach him. At last the herdsman followed him into a cleft
of the rock, where he found a lovely garden filled with fruits,
exquisite of colour and unknown to man. The herdsman plucked one, but
was afraid to taste it, and, as he passed out, a demon snatched it from
his hand. He consulted a doctor, who recommended him next time to eat
the fruit. When he again met the demon, who as before tried to pluck it
out of his hand, the herdsman ate it. But no sooner had it reached his
stomach than it began to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href=
"#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>swell inside him, and he grew so
enormous, that although his head was outside, his body was jammed in
the fissure of the rock. His friends in vain tried to release him, and
he was gradually changed into stone. Ages after, a king who believed
that such a stone must possess medical virtues, tried to chisel away a
small portion, but the workmen, after ten days&rsquo; labour, were not
able to get even a pinch of dust.</p>
<p>These treasure rocks, which open to the touch of magic, are common
in folk-lore.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5497src" href="#xd21e5497"

<h3 class="main">Ghosts of Roads.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bh&ucirc;ts are also found at roads, cross-roads, and
boundaries. It is so in Russia, where, &ldquo;at cross-roads, or in the
neighbourhood of cemeteries, an animated corpse often lurks watching
for some unwary traveller whom it may be able to slay and
eat.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5505src" href="#xd21e5505" name=
"xd21e5505src">157</a> Thus, in the Hills, and indeed as far as Madras,
an approved charm for getting rid of a disease of demoniacal origin is
to plant a stake where four roads meet, and to bury grains underneath,
which crows disinter and eat.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5508src" href=
"#xd21e5508" name="xd21e5508src">158</a> The custom of laying small-pox
scabs on roads has been already noticed. The same idea is probably at
the root of the old English plan of burying suicides at cross-roads,
with a stake driven through the chest of the corpse. In the eastern
parts of the North-West Provinces we have Sewanriya, who, like
Terminus, is a special godling of boundaries, and whose function is to
keep foreign Bh&ucirc;ts from intruding into the village under his
charge. For the same reason the Baiga pours a stream of spirits round
the boundary. This is also probably the basis of a long series of
customs performed, when the bridegroom, with his procession, reaches
the boundary of the bride&rsquo;s village. Of the Kh&acirc;ndh godling
of boundaries, we read:&mdash;&ldquo;He is adored by sacrifices human
and bestial. Particular points upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>the boundaries of
districts, fixed by ancient usage, and generally upon the highways, are
his altars, and these demand each an annual victim, who is either an
unsuspecting traveller struck down by the priests, or a sacrifice
provided by purchase.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5513src" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bh&ucirc;ts particularly infest ancient empty houses.
If a house be unoccupied for any time, a Bh&ucirc;t is sure to take up
his quarters there. Such houses abound everywhere. The old Fort of
Agori on the Son is said to have been abandoned on account of the
malignancy of its Bh&ucirc;ts. Not long ago a merchant built a splendid
house in the Mirzapur B&acirc;z&acirc;r, and was obliged to abandon it
for the same reason. The Collector&rsquo;s house at Sah&acirc;ranpur is
haunted by a young English lady; there is one in the Jh&acirc;nsi
cantonment, where a Bh&ucirc;t, in the form of a Faq&icirc;r, dressed
in white clothes, appears at night. Fortunately he is of a kindly
disposition.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ghosts of Flowers.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bh&ucirc;ts occasionally take up their abode in
flowers, and hence it is dangerous to allow children to smell them. In
Kumaun the Betaina tree (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia sempervivens</i>) is
supposed to be infested by Bh&ucirc;ts, and its flowers are never used
as offerings to the gods.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5529src" href=
"#xd21e5529" name="xd21e5529src">160</a> But, on the other hand, as we
shall see elsewhere, flowers and fruits are considered scarers of
demons. Bh&ucirc;ts, it is believed, do their cooking at noon and
evening, so women and children should be cautious about walking at such
times, lest they should tread unwittingly upon this ghostly food and
incur the resentment of its owners.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5532src"

<h3 class="main">The Hearth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the many places where Bh&ucirc;ts resort comes
the house hearth. This probably in a large measure accounts for the
precautions taken by Hindus in preparing and protecting the family
cooking-place, and smearing it with fresh cowdung, which is a scarer of
demons. The idea was common among all the Aryan races,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5545src" href="#xd21e5545" name=
"xd21e5545src">163</a> but it is found also among the Dr&acirc;vidian
tribes, who perform much of the worship of Dulha Deo and similar family
guardians at the family hearth. In Northern India, when a bride first
goes to the house of her husband she is not permitted to cook. On an
auspicious day, selected by the family priest, she commences her
duties, and receives presents of money and jewellery from her
relations. Among the low castes, at marriages a special rite, that of
Matmangara, or &ldquo;lucky earth,&rdquo; is performed, when the earth
intended for the preparation of the marriage cooking-place is brought
home. The women go in procession to the village clay-pit, accompanied
by a Cham&acirc;r beating a drum, which is decorated with streaks of
red lead. The earth is dug by the village Baiga, who passes five
shovelfuls into the breast-cloth of a veiled virgin, who stands behind
him. So, in Bih&acirc;r, after bathing the bride and bridegroom, the
mother or female guardian brings home a clod of earth, out of which a
rude fireplace is prepared. On this butter is burnt, and paddy parched
on the threshold of the kitchen, where the spirit is supposed to dwell.
A goat is sacrificed at the same time, and some of this parched paddy
is reserved, to be flung over the pair as they make the marriage
revolutions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5548src" href="#xd21e5548"
name="xd21e5548src">164</a></p>
<p>For the same reason great care is taken of the ashes, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>which must be removed with caution and not
allowed to fall on the ground. We have seen that it is used to identify
the spirits of the returning dead, and ashes blown over by a holy man
are used to expel the Evil Eye. In Bombay a person excommunicated from
caste is re-admitted on swallowing ashes given him by the religious
teacher of the caste.</p>
<p>Most Hindus particularly dislike being watched at their meals, and
make a pretence of eating in secret. If on a walk round your camp you
come on one of your servants eating, he pretends not to recognize his
master, and his hang-dog look is the equivalent of the ordinary salaam.
This is an idea which prevails in many parts of the world. The
Vaishnava sect of R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5557src" href="#xd21e5557" name="xd21e5557src">165</a> are very
particular in this respect. They cook for themselves, and should the
meal during its preparation, or while they are eating, attract the
looks of a stranger, the operation is instantly stopped, and the food
buried in the ground.</p>

<p class="first">Bh&ucirc;ts, again, frequent privies and dirty places
of all kinds. Hence the caution with which a Hindu performs the offices
of nature, his aversion to going into a privy at night, and the
precaution he uses of taking a brass vessel with him on such occasions.
Mr. Campbell supposes this to depend on the experience of the
disease-bearing properties of dirt.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5565src"
href="#xd21e5565" name="xd21e5565src">166</a> &ldquo;This belief
explains the puzzling inconsistencies of Hindus of all classes that the
house, house door, and a little in front is scrupulously clean, while
the yard may be a dung-heap or a privy. As long as the house is clean,
the Bh&ucirc;t cannot come in. Let him live in the privy; he cannot do
much harm there.&rdquo;</p>

particularly object to people standing on their roof, and in a special
degree to a buffalo getting upon it. It is on the roof, too, that the

most recent authority on the subject, Mr. Hartland, sums up the matter
thus: &ldquo;It is founded on the belief that the child is a part of
the parent; and, just as after apparent severance of hair and nails
from the remainder of the body, the bulk is affected by anything which
happens to the severed portion, so as well after as before the infant
has been severed from the parent&rsquo;s body, and in our eyes has
acquired a distinct existence, he will be affected by whatever operates
on the parent. Hence whatever the parent ought for the child&rsquo;s
sake to do or avoid before severance it is equally necessary to do or
avoid after. Gradually, however, as the infant grows and strengthens he
becomes able to digest the same food as his parents, and to take part
in the ordinary avocations of their lives. Precaution then may be
relaxed, and ultimately remitted altogether,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Legend
of Perseus,&rdquo; ii. 406.</p>
